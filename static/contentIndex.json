Obsidian has revolutionized the way we capture and connect our thoughts, but imagine harnessing the power of artificial intelligence to further enhance your workflow. That’s where Smart Connections and Smart Connect come in, offering a bridge between your Obsidian vault and the incredible capabilities of AI, and even a direct connection to ChatGPT.\nImportant distinction: Before we dive in, let’s clarify the difference between these two powerful tools:\n\nSmart Connections Obsidian Plugin: This plugin is the magic behind AI integration within Obsidian itself. It uses embedding models to understand the content and context of your notes, allowing for intelligent connections and insights without ever leaving your vault.\nSmart Connect Software: Think of this as a bridge between ChatGPT and Obsidian – it connects your Obsidian vault to ChatGPT, enabling you to chat directly with your notes and have ChatGPT perform actions within Obsidian without uploading your data to the cloud.\n\nUnveiling Hidden Relationships with Smart Connections\nFirst things first, let’s install the Smart Connections plugin from the Obsidian community plugins. Once installed and enabled, Smart Connections starts working behind the scenes, analyzing your notes and creating “embeddings.” These embeddings are like digital fingerprints that capture the essence of each note, allowing the AI to understand how they relate to each other.\nOne of the coolest features of Smart Connections is the “Smart View.” Imagine you’re working on a note about, say, “The Benefits of Meditation.” With Smart View enabled, a sidebar appears, displaying other notes in your vault that are contextually relevant to your current note. This could include notes on mindfulness, stress reduction, or even specific meditation techniques. 🧘‍♀️ It’s like having your own personal research assistant, surfacing connections you might have otherwise missed!\n\nChatting with Your Notes Using Smart Connect in ChatGPT\nReady to have a conversation with your knowledge base? Smart Connect makes it possible! Download and install the Smart Connect software, and let’s set up the connection. Within the software, you’ll specify the location of your Obsidian vault and give it a name (this helps ChatGPT identify it).\nWith everything connected, head over to the ChatGPT interface in your browser. Here, you can ask questions and give commands related to your Obsidian notes. For example:\n\n“List my notes” - ChatGPT will provide a list of your recent notes, complete with links to open them directly in Obsidian.\n“Give me organization ideas for my new Obsidian vault” - ChatGPT will generate a new note within your Obsidian vault containing suggestions for organizing your notes effectively.\n“Create PARA folders in my vault” - ChatGPT will automatically create the folders for the PARA method (Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives) within your Obsidian vault, providing a structure to get you started.\n\n\nThese are just a few basic examples. The possibilities are truly endless! You can ask ChatGPT to summarize notes, find specific information, or even generate creative content based on your existing knowledge.\nJoin the Smart Connections Community\nSmart Connections is more than just software; it’s a community of passionate knowledge seekers and creators. Join us in the GitHub discussions to connect with other users, share your experiences, and learn from each other. There’s also a private chat available to project supporters where you can get prioritized support and further contribute to shaping the future of Smart Connections.\nEmbrace the Future of Note-Taking with AI\nSmart Connections and Smart Connect unlock a whole new dimension in knowledge management. By leveraging the power of AI, you can discover hidden connections, gain deeper insights, and boost your productivity within Obsidian. And the best part? This is just the beginning! As both software continue to evolve, we can expect even more innovative features and exciting possibilities.\nReady to join the AI revolution in Obsidian?

Pick the perfect brain to match your workflow’s needs. Supports local models, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, Cohere Command-R, OpenAI GPT-4 &amp; Open Router with over 100 models including Meta’s Llama 3.\nLocal Chat Model Configuration: Keep your chats local and your data private. Use the local model configurations to use models running in Ollama and LM Studio with Smart Chat.\nRedesigned Smart Chat: Smart Chat has been rewritten from the ground up, setting the stage for future features like in-chat actions that promise to revolutionize your interactions.\n\n\nFeature Breakdown\n\nSmart Chat Enhancements: Essential settings like model selection in the Smart Chat window! This update lays the important groundwork necessary for these settings. Need more control? Let me know which settings you’d like to see by creating a feature request.\nChat History Feature: Never lose a good idea again. Every conversation is saved right back into your Obsidian vault, making it easy to revisit past insights. This also makes it easy for Smart Chat to re-use conversations as context in the future!\nSystem Prompts Feature: Another new addition is the ability to create and use system prompts that can be easily integrated into your chat conversations. Simply type @ to list notes from your smart prompts folder. Smart system prompts describe your preferences, like the custom instructions in ChatGPT, to reduce the input required for future queries. For example, I have a system prompt that specifies my coding preferences, and I use this when making a code related query.\nJS Brains: Code can be messy. And depending on other peoples code, code which often further depends on other people’s code, can get really messy really fast. JS Brains is a collection of open-source JavaScript modules I personally developed for Smart Connections for the explicit purpose of reducing dependencies on external code bases. I made some notes about why reducing dependencies is important for maintaining privacy and security here.\n\n\nStill wondering how to utilize Smart Connections?
