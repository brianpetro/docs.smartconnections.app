Pick the perfect brain to match your workflow‚Äôs needs. Supports¬†local models, Anthropic¬†Claude, Google¬†Gemini, Cohere Command-R, OpenAI¬†GPT-4¬†&amp; Open Router with over 100 models including¬†Meta‚Äôs Llama 3.\nLocal Chat Model Configuration: Keep your chats local and your data private. Use the local model configurations to use models running in Ollama and LM Studio with Smart Chat.\nRedesigned Smart Chat: Smart Chat has been rewritten from the ground up, setting the stage for future features like in-chat actions that promise to revolutionize your interactions.\n\n\nFeature Breakdown\n\nSmart Chat Enhancements: Essential settings like model selection in the Smart Chat window! This update lays the important groundwork necessary for these settings. Need more control? Let me know which settings you‚Äôd like to see by creating a feature request.\nChat History Feature: Never lose a good idea again. Every conversation is saved right back into your Obsidian vault, making it easy to revisit past insights. This also makes it easy for Smart Chat to re-use conversations as context in the future!\nSystem Prompts Feature: Another new addition is the ability to create and use system prompts that can be easily integrated into your chat conversations. Simply type @ to list notes from your smart prompts folder. Smart system prompts describe your preferences, like the custom instructions in ChatGPT, to reduce the input required for future queries. For example, I have a system prompt that specifies my coding preferences, and I use this when making a code related query.\nJS Brains: Code can be messy. And depending on other peoples code, code which often further depends on other people‚Äôs code, can get really messy really fast. JS Brains is a collection of open-source JavaScript modules I personally developed for Smart Connections for the explicit purpose of reducing dependencies on external code bases. I made some notes about why reducing dependencies is important for maintaining privacy and security here.\n\n\nStill wondering how to utilize Smart Connections?
