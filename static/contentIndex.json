As many of you know, our primary mission is to empower individuals with AI through open-source software. Achieving this mission requires us to navigate the delicate spectrum between providing a stable user experience and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible.\nUnderstanding the Spectrum Between Stability and Innovation\nI completely understand the desire for stability. It’s something I strive for with each update, aiming to ensure that new users can dive right in without any hiccups. However, I’ve come to realize that the more we focus solely on stability, the more we potentially limit the innovation of the software. Stability and innovation often exist on opposite ends of a spectrum, and prioritizing one can inadvertently suppress the other.\nWhy Innovation Takes Precedence\nI believe that leaning towards innovation—even if it means sacrificing stability at times—is essential for achieving those tenfold improvements that truly make a difference. By focusing on what a 10x improvement might look like, we open doors to advancements that can significantly enhance the way we interact with AI.\nOur mission isn’t just about creating software that works; it’s about pioneering tools that can empower you in ways previously unimagined. This long-term vision sometimes requires us to accept periods of instability as we explore new frontiers.\nManaging Instability During Innovation\nTo help manage this, I’ve created early release versions for supporters. This approach allows us to introduce cutting-edge features while maintaining a level of stability in the main release. However, there are times when updating the stable release introduces some instability, and I acknowledge that this can be frustrating.\nI encourage you to share your feedback and report any issues you encounter. Your involvement is invaluable and helps us improve more rapidly. Remember, this is a collaborative effort, and your patience and understanding make a significant difference.\nFuture Plans and Vision\nLooking ahead, I’m excited about the innovations on the horizon. From enhancing the Smart Connect app to integrating new functionalities, we’re working on features that I believe will greatly enhance your experience.\nI want to assure you that while stability is important, innovation remains our driving force. It’s through continuous innovation that we’ll achieve our goal of empowering individuals with AI.\nConclusion\nThank you for being part of this journey. Your support and enthusiasm fuel our progress. Together, we’ll continue to build and refine the Smart Ecosystem, embracing innovation while striving for the best possible user experience.\n🌴"},"Community-Lean-Coffee-meetings/Community-Lean-Coffee-2024-09-20":{"title":"Community Lean Coffee 2024-09-20","links":["Blog/Stability-vs-Innovation-in-the-Smart-Ecosystem"],"tags":[],"content":"\nnotes\n\nStability vs Innovation in the Smart Ecosystem\n\ntranscript\nMatthew Oatts\nOf a church, and I was a leader in the church when the pandemic happened. And so I was, like, the youngest person, and I was the one that had figure out how we’re gonna do, like, virtual services and all this kind of stuff. And at that time, you know, teaching a bunch of people who could barely know how to access their, you know, email, how to join a Zoom meeting, and then what to actually do on a Zoom meeting and all that stuff was a whole experience. But one of the things that we very quickly learned that we needed to do is to have everybody always be on mute when they join. And we didn’t do a waiting room, but we definitely had, like, a moderator who was, like, ready to kick people out, which is very weird in a religious situation, to be like, oh, who’s going to get punched out of the room next?\nStefano Coppo\nI know.\nMatthew Oatts\nYeah.\nMatthew Oatts\nExcommunicated from the Zoom call. That was fun as a member of a community trying to figure out how people and technology, you know, interact with that.\nStefano Coppo\nSo.\nStefano Coppo\nWell, obviously, I hadn’t really factored that into my calculus that, you know, I’m used to meetings that are closed, business meetings, you know, and you have a prescribed list of attendees, and. But then when you open this up broadly, you know, for a public forum, boy, you got to be guarded and ready.\nMatthew Oatts\nYou saw me. I wasn’t really ready. I was. I told my wife, and I was like. I was like, I don’t want to. I certainly don’t want to watch what happened, but I want to watch everybody else’s reactions. I was like, yeah, so I haven’t gotten around to doing that yet. But anyway, all right. People will be mysteriously confused if they watch this recording as to what we’re talking about, but it’s a secret. All right, so I’m in the Miro board. I can share my screen. And then one of the things I’m thinking, since at the moment it’s the same crew of folks, is maybe we could just, like, go back to where we left off last time. I could copy that down. Let’s see.\n🌴 Brian\nNot the screen. Yeah, that sounds good to me.\nMatthew Oatts\nJust the right screen. Yeah. Okay, here we go. So we can just change this to be the September 6 and 20th meeting, and then maybe take a look at where things landed here. And if there’s anything I do. I mean, I got to go look at my notes. I do want to have, like, three or four minutes to find some stuff that I had compiled to add to the board. So maybe I’ll just start a timer for I’ll start a timer for, like, four minutes, and then we can add extra topics if you think of it. And I’m going to have to find where it’s and. Was.\n🌴 Brian\nYeah, I just added a couple topics that came up on the GitHub where, you know, they’re pretty, pretty broad topics. So I didn’t want to, you know, be spending the time answering in text. I figured this would be a good format.\nMatthew Oatts\nYeah. Oh, that way too. We could record it and you could have the clip and then you could post a clip to. This is how we answer the question. So by the way, I’m totally cool with that. If you, if there’s things where you sometimes, especially if it’s like not too many people, you know, I’m not going to speak for Stefano here, but Brian, if there’s like a. You have a backlog, it’s just going to be easier to talk about these things, you know, and just knock out things quickly within the hour of the lean coffee.\n🌴 Brian\nI’m perfectly okay with that. Yeah. So I added them in there in case you guys are interested in the topics. But, you know, I don’t like, at least this time, I don’t feel like we specifically, specifically have to get to them. I think it was Justin from the community is the one who posed the questions. I invited him. So, you know, if he shows up, I think that that would be a good time to go into it. But, you know, if he doesn’t show up, then I’m fine with sticking to, you know, whatever we agree is top priority today.\nMatthew Oatts\nI’ve added a couple that are sort of minor, mostly because I sort of troubleshoot. Troubleshooted. I don’t know what that word is. Some things on my own and I couldn’t figure out actually how it works. So I added a few things here. Stefano, did you have anything else you wanted to add to the Miro board?\nStefano Coppo\nNo, I’ll follow the lead here. I do have some technical glitches I’m running into, but I noted we’re not to address those unless they’ve been documented in the get. So I want to wait until I can properly document them and then we can go from there.\n🌴 Brian\nSo, Stefano, those are probably that you’re referring to the Smart Connect app.\nStefano Coppo\nYeah. Thank you for your help. It was my oversight as far as custom GPT, so I’ve got that. But I’m running into some other issues that I want to just really understand before I throw out a false negative. So I am having some issues with that and just chatting with my notes, basically my resume to job description matching. Is kind of broken at this point, so.\n🌴 Brian\nOkay, yeah, if you create a GitHub issue, I’ll definitely check it out. But I just want to also mention that the Smart Connect app is a little bit behind right now. You know, like I pretty much spent since the last meeting getting the plugin up to speed. And, you know, now a lot of the changes that happened in the plugin, you know, since they share the same, a lot of the same open source components, the Smart Connect app still needs to catch up. Plus there’s a few things I want to add specifically to the Smart Connect app. So whatever the issues you’re running into, if you post about them in the next few days, that would be a great time because I’ll be hopping into that code.\nStefano Coppo\nOkay. And when you speak to shared open source, is that your JSBrainss?\n🌴 Brian\nThat’s correct.\nStefano Coppo\nOkay.\n🌴 Brian\nYeah, there’s, you know, I would say 90% of all the code is shared between the plugin and the app via those JSBrainss components.\nStefano Coppo\nAnd as I track your changes and the change logs, I do detect that you’re making changes to the JSBrainss, which then are foundational to probably the plugin and the Smart Connect proxy.\n🌴 Brian\nYeah, yeah. So long term vision for JSBrainss is actually somewhat like a framework that people could use to build, you know, similar, similar software. So, you know, like a lot like, there’s kind of almost like a meme in the AI space, which is like, all of these startups are like, they’re essentially chat with your PDF startups. Yeah. You know, so I think that with the open source components that I’m building there, you know, I could provide a demo or like example where it’s like build this chat with your PDF application and really very few lines of code, and that application would work in the browser. There could be another example to make it a desktop app. The beauty of that open source project is it’s all vanilla JavaScript for the most part. There’s a little bit of node js in there. I actually make it not dependent on node JS because that’s what enables the mobile version of the Obsidian plugin to work, because the mobile version of Obsidian does not have access. To node js, like the desktop app does. But that side effect makes it so that the code in that open source repository ends up working virtually everywhere that you can run a web browser.\nStefano Coppo\nYeah, no, very elegant. I think. So I like the architecture, and I kind of followed that as I saw the micro changes you were making to JSBrainss.\n🌴 Brian\nYeah. And then just one last little bit. The JSBrainss. The reason for the name is because I spend a lot of my time learning about the brain. And, you know, there’s specifically this guy, Jeff Hawkins. He writes the thousand brains book and also on intelligence, and he takes a look at, like, how the brain works, but from, like, a technology perspective. And I really. It’s. I really think it’s, like, one of the best architectures for building an intelligent application that I’ve come across. So a lot of the changes are, like, me trying to figure out how can I make the code better reflect this cortical architecture. And the beauty of that is, if I can get it to emulate that cortical architecture that he describes, it’s like a recursive type of system. So really, it’s like, once that base is developed, that base architecture, you can just add layer upon layer upon layer. And with those layers, I think you can do really, really cool things. So that’s the high level direction, you know, from a. From a cognitive architecture standpoint.\nStefano Coppo\nOkay, cool.\nMatthew Oatts\nSweet. That was a fun little side conversation. So I captured some notes around that here.\n🌴 Brian\nOh, cool. Yeah. And if you guys are interested in the cognitive architecture stuff, I think his books are very accessible. You know, like, they’re. They’re fun listens, and I. You know, like, I think he does a great job of, you know, packing a lot of information in. You know, I can tell you that, you know, I own the hard copies and the audible versions of both books. You know, like, I’ve. I’ve highlighted the. The hard copies, and I’ve listened to the audible versions of each book. Easily a dozen times, which is, you know, pretty, you know, it’s like that’s, that’s definitely an outlier. You know, like, I listen to a lot of books multiple times, you know, when they, when they deserve a re listen, you know, but approaching a dozen times, you know, for each, I think, really gives, you know, credit to the, the quality of information he has in there.\nMatthew Oatts\nHow do you, what is, what is this word? Cortical architecture.\n🌴 Brian\nYeah. So it’s like, you know, I guess, you know, like a derivative of the cortex.\nMatthew Oatts\nCortical architect. Is that how you spell it?\n🌴 Brian\nYeah, that looks correct.\nMatthew Oatts\nArchitecture. All right, cool. I put a little link to your JSBrainss thing here. And then I also put a link to. And I told you about this hack that I do when I explain things to people. I just ask perplexity and then copy the conversation so people can have all the little nodes to go off of. Oh, yeah. While you guys were talking, I just essentially terribly misspelled the question. Tell me more about this and all that kind of stuff. And so it generated a little article for us around that. So I included those links and some fun stickies to get us going here.\n🌴 Brian\nYeah. Yeah, that’s a. I love how you do that.\nMatthew Oatts\nCool. All right, so I’m going to, I personally think instead of voting, I. Stefano, I don’t know about you, but I’d love to have Brian just dealer’s choice, pluck some of these things off based upon what’s top of mind for him if, like, I don’t have a strong opinion about any of these topics. So, Stefano, what do you think about offering Brian that opportunity?\nStefano Coppo\nI concur.\n🌴 Brian\nOkay.\nMatthew Oatts\nOkay. Go for it, Brian. Let me just tell you which one you want to talk about.\n🌴 Brian\nThere’s two at the bottom. You know, those are the topics that I mentioned, you know, were brought up on the GitHub. So since they’ve been. Yeah. So since they’ve been in my mind, I’ll just, I’ll give a brief overview of my thoughts there.\n🌴 Brian\nSo, you know, to elaborate on the software stability question. You know, the, the sentiment was, you know, like, you know, now that the plugin is working properly, like, is there a way we can ensure the stability? And I definitely see why that would be desired. And it’s something that I do try my best to accomplish. I want there to be a stable version of the software so any new user that comes to get the plugin can just hop right in and not have any issues. But the trouble is, is that I see stability being on a spectrum with innovation. And the more stable the software, I think it’s going to reduce the innovation of the software. So while I try to keep things working, I really don’t want to promise stability because I think it’s the innovation side of the spectrum where ten x outcomes will develop. And that I think contributes more to the primary mission, which is empowering individuals with AI through this open source software by leaning towards innovation, I think even sacrificing stability for intermittent periods of time. I think in the long term we will better empower individuals with AI by discovering new innovations, by worrying less about stability and focusing more on what might a ten x improvement look like. I also, from the development side of things like I created the early release for supporters so that there could be some level of stability in the main release. But there’s always this period of time where I need to update that stable release or update that general release, and that’s where the instability starts to, to arise. So I would love to say that the software is going to be stable from here on out, but I think that’s a promise I can’t make, and it’s one that I don’t think I want to make because I think for the long term mission, innovation is the goal. So did you guys have any questions about that?\nMatthew Oatts\nI do. Do you mind if I ask you some almost interview style cutting questions? Because you know me, I support your mission wholeheartedly. But then I do think there’s a perspective that I think people would want that like better understand. So you mind if I like, sort of like I’m going to seem like I’m coming at you, but I’m actually just trying to challenge you because I think it would be healthy to have people better understand what you’re getting at. Is that okay?\n🌴 Brian\nI 100% love that. Okay.\nMatthew Oatts\nYou know, cool. Sounds good. So a question. One question that I have for you is if stability is necessary for there to be a adoption and usage, then where are you positioned? Part of me goes to from a Runway funding vision perspective, if that were to happen and then user base were to drop. Or I think more importantly, the cohort of people who are deep power users give up and potentially don’t return. How does that impact your journey towards your vision? Is that you seem to be describing that the conditions don’t require you to, like, stability isn’t as necessary as maybe certain power users or people, you know, believe that it should be. Is that what’s, is there any truth in that? Like what’s your position with respect to that? Does that, first of all, does the question make sense? Because I just thought of a simpler way to ask the question.\n🌴 Brian\nSo if the question, so if you think there’s a simpler way, that will also give me some.\nMatthew Oatts\nIf your user base were to plummet, can you still continue?\n🌴 Brian\nSo I think that the answer to that is yes. Because while the like, that would be negative, that would be a negative impact on progress. The reason why I think I would still be able to continue is that there is a lot to do with marketing and growth type of plans that I’ve been sort of just collecting these like, ideas and these different like avenues and directions. I could go along those lines. So I think that the recovery from that situation is very much doable.\nMatthew Oatts\nAnd for this helps provide clarity, I think, which is useful, I think I’m cracking exactly what you’re saying.\n🌴 Brian\nYeah, because I think that I’ve been putting the marketing and growth in the same bucket as stability. Where like right now, if I spend my energy on that marketing and like growing the user base, then that actually not only directly takes my focus away from the innovation, but it also increases the need for stability. Because presumably, if I’m going on that marketing growth route, I’m trying to either sell more subscriptions or get more supporters. So then I feel more obligated to keep those people happy and that would increase the urgency and the importance of that stability. But, you know, right now I have a pretty okay Runway where I can feel comfortable just going the direction that I see best for creating the best software and the best innovations with regards to that, for at least the. Few months. Even if all the revenue stopped coming in today, I could still keep going for at minimum a few months, and then that would be prior to me even switching gears into the marketing. I would also still want to leave myself a few months to get things going again from the marketing and growth standpoint. But if everything dried up today, I could still spend a few months working on improving those innovations. And when I came back to the marketing and growth plan, assuming everybody just was like, okay, this doesn’t work, we’re not using it, well, then I would actually be able to move even faster on the innovations and I would hope to come back with what instead of being, hey, this is the same as all those chat with your PDF startups, except for it’s in your Obsidian. You know, like, instead of just being like this alternative to all these things that exist, I would come back to the market with something extra, something new. And I think that also lines up with how I see this persisting into the future. Because if I have a very stable software that does the same thing as a bunch of other software out there, then eventually people are going to say, oh, well, you know what? I’m already in Google Docs all the time, so let me just use Google’s notebook LM, or like, I’m already in Microsoft, so let me just use copilot. Like, if I don’t focus on the innovating, I think that that same drop in users is going to happen regardless of the stability, because there’s going to be equivalent alternatives that may be more convenient than what’s in Obsidian or with the application and ChatGPT.\nMatthew Oatts\nCool.\n🌴 Brian\nDid that answer your question?\nMatthew Oatts\nYeah. So I was sort of drawing this little picture, and for me, what it does is, as someone who’s bought into the mission, but quite frankly, also my usage has absolutely tailed off in the last, I don’t know, three months part significantly because my own factors, but also because it’s difficult to get back in the pool if wherever I left things off and the settings don’t work. Like, I don’t even know if you noticed this, but in the last recording when I was like, oh yeah, what about this little field? You probably didn’t even notice that I hadn’t even filled in the required fields to have the thing even work at all. And so you could immediately see from my configuration that nothing would work. Well, I hadn’t seen those fields because I hadn’t been in the pool for the last, you know, 30 days. And so part of what’s useful and what you’re describing, and I sort of got a little bit of like, My product manager type hat on here is like, with effort, intent. Part of what I heard you just describe as a story is like right now you’re experiencing some growth without any effort or intent. So you’re sort of at this inflection point is if you stop, and I actually think this is what you described as a little bit different than this, but like, you could just keep trying to make things stable and things might continue to increase. I think what you’re saying is that green line actually tapers off and go and crashes permanently if you just focus on stability. Whereas if you do a little bit of mix of both, then you might be able to stay, but it’s still going to recover if you don’t actually worry about stability, sure your users might plummet, but to the point, this black line where if they do get low, all you have to do is actually turn on with like, effort and intent around marketing if you needed to do that. So I love how you’re characterizing the fact that, like, the growth right now is based upon, you know, not as much intent around trying to grow user base. So you can afford to have attrition as much as it, from an emotional perspective, might frustrate users because they’ve invested time, energy and effort into a thing that they just want to work for them the way that they encountered it at first. Like from a bigger picture impact, you are differentiated enough that if you focus on innovation, it might hurt a little bit with some people, but it gives you the better shot that months down the road you’ll have something that they won’t be able to get to again from anywhere else, which is, quite frankly, where they encountered you the first time. So I totally am picking up\n🌴 Brian\non, I love this diagram here. I think that yellow, you know, like while the green would be great, I think the yellow is definitely what I anticipate happening. You know, like at some point it’s going to tail off and I’m going to need to put that effort in the marketing. I mean, that’s been the plan the whole time. I see the current features, and this is probably, in my opinion, you know, why things like really tailed off for you, is that the features are more of a novelty than truly useful. Yeah, like, and the reason why I know that is because I build this software, the reason I first built it was for myself and I want to use it myself and even my own usage, you know, I see it tailing off. As far as the Smart Chat within Obsidian, I very rarely use the Smart Chat in Obsidian. I’m I much more frequently use the ChatGPT version. But even that, you know, like besides the transcribing, the the ChatGPT, like where it currently is with the Smart Connect. Connect app, my usage has tailed off there as well. And then with the Smart Connections view in Obsidian to show you similar notes, it can be so much better. So the reason why the suggestions are not so much better, they’ve basically been the same, with the exception of bugs making the suggestions worse at times. But like, as far as the underlying algorithms go, nothing really has changed there. But I see so much opportunity to improve just that Smart Connections view itself from being able to add feedback into the Smart Connections view, so that even if you look at the same note at a future time, the suggestions would be better, and then that bleeds over into the chat being more useful.\nMatthew Oatts\nYeah, I wonder too, based upon what you’re describing, and I know we can probably hop to the other part of the topic here, but the part of the effect, I think we were. So, because I played video games, but it’s not just a video game thing in the last decade, the hijacking of what it really means to be in alpha, in early release, in like, being a part of a thing that you get early access to something, and then the sort of mutual and understanding and agreement that by definition that means a thing that’s different than if it was software that you’re paying for that’s stable. I think that’s gotten so watered down and dissolved that we just were desensitized to it. And so, like, part of the, like, the only reason I’m, you know, continuing to, I can’t remember, I think I did the yearly plan, I was always confused as to whether or not there’s a yearly plan or whatever. But, like, part of the reason I very quickly learned I’m actually not giving you, you know, a few hundred bucks a year for an app. I’m actually giving it into a mission. And I think that transaction is probably nothing deeply understood. And that’s not a you thing, that’s just the pragmatic reality of how you get something. That’s innovation, that’s from a small company without a lot of overhead, like a small entity without a lot of overhead. Like, that’s just part of it. And I think part of the struggle is just to grapple with that, that reality, because I could also probably spend the equivalent or same amount of money to a corporation that is going to have 40% to 60% of the same things that maybe I would intend to do right now, maybe a little bit more with Smart Connections, but it’s not going to check other boxes. Like, I’m not going to be able to own the files. And, like, the root of the data, and someone else is going to use my data. So I think it’s just individual users. We as a community also just have to grapple with, like, what we’re spending our money on. And there’s no, like, universal right answer for people there, too. Like, it is completely understandable if people, you know, thought they were going to be getting a stable thing, even though they probably are looking past the fact that they’re not necessarily getting a stable thing. And then, you know, I believe you would probably encourage people to say, like, hey, if that, you know, if that’s too much money for you to spend now that you realize, like, don’t, don’t give me your money. I don’t want to go into that agreement with you is sort of what I’m picking up on from you as well, is like, you want people to have what they need and that’s okay. Like, you don’t need. You would probably rather not have someone’s money to have them have a false expectation of what they’re actually getting in exchange.\n🌴 Brian\nThat’s 100% accurate. You know, like, I’m, I’m really, even though, you know, it was in the terms of the transaction not being a well understood type of transaction in general, I’m glad that you really picked up on what I was trying to go for. I really do position everything as you’re supporting the project, even the subscription, which is more of a productization of the Smart Connect app for access via chat, GPT, even that. I spent a lot of time making sure that I position the offer such that it’s an offer to support the ongoing work on the project rather than purchasing this product. And, you know, I really have no hesitation if somebody comes to me and they say, you know what, I didn’t, you know, like, I didn’t know what I was getting into. Can I get a refund? Like, I will give you a refund, no questions asked, and you can keep the license key, you know, for as long as it’s active for, you know, they do expire eventually, you know, but the purpose there, like, to, you know, like, for this positioning was so that, yes, I can fund the continued work, but also without bringing in unnecessary headaches, you know, because if it was too strictly a product, there are, you know, like, well, it’s not very understood, this, like, support type of transaction. What is very well understood is that if you buy a product, you’re going to get support. You’re going to have expectations that the thing’s going to work all the time. And I really wanted to avoid that expectation as much as possible. You know, not that everybody’s going to understand everything immediately, but, you know, as far as getting into the second part of these two topics that were in there, I think we really did. Hit both already.\nMatthew Oatts\nYou know, like, I think so.\n🌴 Brian\nYou know that the growth plans, I mean, I’ve got a lot of cool ideas that I’m working on, you know, like as far as innovating and improving the software, and that that’s where I really believe the growth is going to come from. You know what I, you know, like, while I could put this extra time into the marketing, I think that the real growth will happen when the innovation happens, such that when you look at the alternatives, it’s no longer that they check 40% to 60% of the box, is that when you look at the alternatives, they don’t check that one box that matters most. And that, I think, comes from that innovation. And I think that’s where the real growth happens.\nStefano Coppo\nBrian, I have. That’s excellent. It gives me a strong understanding. And I like the way you visualized kind of stability, innovation, tension, the natural tension that exists between those two goals. And I like the way things are going. One thing that has slowed me down maybe, is, for instance, you’re building for multiple platforms, and I think you’re using a framework that lets you code once distribute on Mac and Windows platforms. So in the case of Smart Connect, for instance, it’s a forced update. And my feeling was that you did that so that you got everybody up on the same code stream, and that’s going to probably reduce the support that you need to provide. You don’t have three versions of Smart Connect out there across two different platforms with minimal resources trying to support that. But sometimes that forced update puts me in a position where what was working isn’t working any longer, or there wasn’t adequate documentation, and I didn’t understand that. Action groups is now where you go to, you know, fiddle with custom GPT settings, that sort of thing. In the case of the plugin, you’ve allowed a contributor to go into an advanced version with a cautionary note that it might be less stable, but you’re going to get a first glimpse. At some innovation that I’m providing and if it doesn’t work for you, there’s a revert back to a known more stable version. So I don’t have an ultimate answer to that, but so I understand your thinking and your motivation to do what you’ve done with Smart Connect. So I’m tolerant of that. But I’m wondering if and also when I stuck my hand up and said, hey, I’ll write some documentation, and then realized, man, I can’t keep up with the pace, what version of the product am I going to be writing documentation for? Which 01:00 a.m. i going to be screenshotting which 01:00 a.m. i going to develop a video for. So I kind of quickly jumped in the back of the line at that point and said, wow, I can’t keep track of that. So some of that organic marketing could happen maybe if we did have a body of documentation that was for a known stable release. And here we have this more innovative, cutting edge set of releases and you kind of use at your own risk, adopt as needed, and if it doesn’t work for you, you can revert back. I don’t know if that makes sense. That was a ramble.\n🌴 Brian\nNo, I think it makes a lot of sense. So I actually, I just want to make it a note for myself. You know, basically I think what you’re sort of asking is, you know, can there be a early release and stable release for the Smart Connect app similar to the plugin?\nMatthew Oatts\nThat was, that’s what I heard.\nStefano Coppo\nI have those thoughts on occasion, yeah.\n🌴 Brian\nOkay, so I’m just making a quick note to myself here. Allow stabilise for SC app. So I’ve had some thoughts about how that would work for the Smart Connect app. I think up until fairly recently it would have been more difficult because, you know, like everything you said was true. There was one part that you missed, which is there’s a server component with the Smart Connect app. So one of the reasons I needed to make sure that the latest update was always forced was because if I made any changes to the server, the prior version may no longer be compatible. However, the server has been very stable. I pretty much it. Like, I’ve made sure that like pretty much all the logic happens in the application rather than the server. The server is about as bare bones as it can get. So I think that having a stable and early release for the, for the Smart Connect app is definitely doable. I don’t want to give any sort of ETA for that, but my thought on how it would work would be something like, I would still potentially force an update on the stable release, but only if necessary. And then, so what it would look like is there would be some sort of like update now button that pops up for getting to the latest release unless there’s some sort of breaking compatibility issue and I need to force it. And I think that there’s, we’re definitely approaching a point with that software where implementing that makes a lot of sense. So I appreciate you bringing that up because that’ll make sure I add a little extra priority to that. Is there, is there anything I missed? Like with regards to, you know, like what would make sense for, for this? For you?\nStefano Coppo\nNo, I think my omission of the server component and then I, I don’t use the plugin Smart Chat that much. My vision was I could use custom GPTs to interface through the Smart Connect proxy to my vault of notes. And that’s kind of where I gravitated towards using this. Then it gave me a couple control points. It gave me OpenAI’s custom GPT controls to, to upload additional files, write custom instructions. It also gave me the Obsidian alignment notes and what I can do there. So I felt I had this Obsidian and custom GPT configurability around my raspberry PI second brain or my old guy health vault that I wanted to have. So that’s where I went with it. I seldom do I use the Smart Chat inside of Obsidian.\n🌴 Brian\nYeah, good to know about that. I think that the Smart Chat will actually pick up an adoption. Right now I’m working on a major, essentially a refactor of those components, which really just brings them up to speed with the other components. One of the outcomes of that will be actually bringing the actions that are available in ChatGPT, bringing that into the Smart Chat. And so one of the reasons why I think that’ll be very interesting to a lot of people is right now those actions are limited to use in ChatGPT, which personally I like, because I don’t have to worry about token usage. So there’s no surprise API bills. And up until this zero one preview model, which seems to be incompatible, you know, with the custom GPTs, up until then, you know, you’re always able to use the latest models, you know, with these actions. But the point about getting the chats in the Smart Chat is that’s going to open up all of the other platforms. So whether you want to try anthropic or any of the other chat model providers out there, having the Smart Chat integrate with the Smart Actions, I think will allow, you know, people to, you know, that don’t want to use OpenAI for whatever reason, you know, to use whatever their preferred provider is, including self hosted models.\nStefano Coppo\nYes. Yeah, good. Yeah, I would, yeah.\n🌴 Brian\nYou’re interested in the self hosted models?\nStefano Coppo\nYeah, I have several of those, and one of my former colleagues I’m introducing to that, and we’re going to train a model self hosted for their business needs. And so we’re coming up to speed on that. But that I would use that then if I had the actions, the Smart Actions in Obsidian and was able to save money and on my own self hosted models, I probably would use, I would stay in Obsidian more.\n🌴 Brian\nYeah, yeah, that makes sense. And I also think it’s surprising to me that, like anthropic and Google haven’t come out with something similar to custom GPTs yet. I really, that’s one of the reasons why this Smart Chat update hasn’t happened sooner, is because I sort of imagined if Google’s Gemini and anthropics Claude had a layer that was equivalent to the custom GPTs, that it would just make a lot more sense for people to pick their preferred provider and that would sort of pigeonhole. The Smart Chat into local models only, which is there’s a huge demand for the local model integration. But while I think it’s a very vocal demand, I don’t think it’s, I don’t think it’s representative of the broader market. I think the broader market mostly just wants to use the platforms that are accessible via the cloud. But I definitely see that that local model integration is very valuable because there is a market for it where they don’t have, there’s not too much user friendly software in the self hosted LLM space. It’s all fairly technical and I think Smart Connect can make it much easier to use those with the Smart Chat integrated into Smart Connect.\nStefano Coppo\nYeah, I agree. You have to have some infrastructure to self host a model. So I agree.\nMatthew Oatts\nI had a question for you. We were talking about the Smart Actions and it sounds like that’s going to be a cool thing. I’m completely frank with you. Don’t know the value prop or like a good usage example of Smart Actions and I just like cranked open my Smart Connect itself and it’s not self as evident to me. Like could we have like a brief sort of description? I can even show my smart app thing, I think, if I need to.\n🌴 Brian\nLike yeah, I think that’s. I’m very happy you brought up that question. So Smart Actions. Smart Actions, right now they are very limited to just what I call crud operations, which is create, read, update, or destroy or delete your notes. So, you know, the actions are very much geared to being able to pull in the notes as context and then with the more recent updates, making editing those notes also possible, which there are definitely some issues in the pipeline that I’m aware of with the editing, but those should be cleaned up in some future releases. But the overall. So while the Smart Actions are currently limited to just interacting with notes in markdown format, one of the objectives of the backend architecture that I’ve been working on is to abstract the markdown pieces of the logic logic and, and have them confined to a like a clear, like this is, this is where the markdown logic. Happens so that we can then add additional file types, and the first one of those is going to be PDF. Unfortunately, we won’t be able to edit PDF’s, but having that readability, I think is going to add a lot of value for a lot of people. But it doesn’t stop at just file types. So the way I look at how the markdown is imported or the PDF’s would be brought into the system, I look at those files as external sources, and there’s virtually unlimited external sources that can be integrated into the platform. So something that I’ve been, I’ve been trying to get everything cleaned up with everything that’s public, but something I really want to work on that’s a personal prototype that will eventually be public, is where the file system integration is right now, adjacent to the file system integration, a browser integration. What that would look like is you have this browser Smart Action where you say, okay, I want to create a Smart Action for my Twitter timeline. So you put in the link to your Twitter page and it will open up the Twitter page, be able to pull in your content from Twitter. And in addition, because of the way it works, would be a browser integration. And that has a lot to do with the underlying framework that Smart Connect uses. So the reason why Smart Connect works on all the different platforms is because at the core it’s essentially a chrome browser. So since we already have that core chrome browser, when you put in your Twitter link, even though they want you to sign in, when you do sign in, all of that authentication just persists in the browser, as it would if you were using any other chrome browser. That really makes the whole authenticating with virtually any website. It makes it the same as if you were just logging in via your normal browser. Interesting. Which that removes a lot of complexity from the development standpoint because, you know, being like, let’s say you were building an automation and you wanted to scrape Twitter.\nMatthew Oatts\nWell, yeah, I was about to say, you’re talking, it feels like almost like RPA like kind of stuff like screen scraping type thing. Things, but it’s not that.\n🌴 Brian\nSo it’s actually not like it’s not screen scraping, because with the browser we would actually have access to the exact HTML. And I imagine the workflow could be fairly simple to build these custom browser actions for a non code, like somebody that doesn’t program themselves. So it would be like this no code paradigm because you put in that URL, and I briefly mentioned this before, but there are going to be community action. So there might be a Twitter browser action that already has a lot of this setup, but just for the sake of discussion, imagine that there’s just a generic browser action. You put in the Twitter link, you log in and then you have ChatGPT say okay, now get the link. ChatGPT gets all of the HTML from that page. What you can do from there is have the ChatGPT come up with what they call selectors. And this may be like a CSS selector, it could be Xpath, anything that is compatible with JavaScript. And then by simply discussing with ChatGPT based on the HTML that was returned by the action, the ChatGPT can come up with like hey, here are these selectors, we can name them as such so that when you call this action in the future, instead of returning all of the HTML, the action will just return the content at these selectors. So maybe you say, I just wanted to return my most recent tweet. So then when you call this action, it returns your most recent tweet, or maybe you wanted to return all the tweets. I think that development right there, just with that browser component, I think that there’s going to be a whole lot possible from that point. So what I was just mentioning would be the read type action.\n🌴 Brian\nBut then there’s also input, you know, like I also want to be able to say schedule a tweet. I think that the same workflow should be possible to say okay, now I need you to click the create tweet button. I need you to come up with the selector to click the, you know, schedule the tweet button. And then, you know, from, from the point of just having this generic browser action, adding a URL and then talking to ChatGPT, I think you could have both data come into the system which can be saved, similar to how notes are saved. So, you know, The tweets can be surfaced even in the Smart Connections pane, but in addition, have actions to be able to say, okay, now that we know what my last tweet was, now let’s schedule a new tweet. And Twitter really just represents any website out there that you may want to retrieve data from and interact with.\nMatthew Oatts\nAnd what’s interesting is one of the things you’re describing, are you familiar with RPA, like the space around RPA?\n🌴 Brian\nVery much so, yeah.\nMatthew Oatts\nOkay, cool. And it has been probably seven years since I messed around with RPA, but my background was in like, business process automation with IBM. But what you’re describing is what sort of. I remember when I had to do, like, the only I got certified on was, like, uipath. But that idea of like, programmatically navigating the Dom of a page and then building in things and adding, you know, different, sort of like the idea of there’s literally no application that you couldn’t technically integrate with at varying levels of interfaces. You know, this, this was relevant, and sounds like it still remains relevant when you don’t actually have API integrations. How do you layer in something that you actually need to have an ape, you need to have an API for on a platform that architecturally isn’t even designed to be able to have an API? And so sort of what you’re talking about has a lot of like, it feels a lot of like sort of similar domains is what RPA solutions have been trying to sort of work on. And I’m sure they’re all brand. I haven’t looked at this industry in years, but I’m sure they’re all branded as AI enabled now, attempting to do what you’re talking about.\n🌴 Brian\nYeah, I think one of the key differences is that from what I remember, a lot of what you’d be building in something like UiPath is the workflow. So you have this flowchart from going from start to finish. What Smart Actions provide are each of the nodes in that workflow. And then as far as getting to them in the correct order, we’re actually able to rely on ChatGPT for coming up with that order. I think that there’s ways that we can force flows or workflows in the future, but I think just having the ability to create those nodes and then let the AI access those nodes in whatever order might be best for the current task, I think that’s hugely valuable.\nMatthew Oatts\nYeah. And that reminds me of, that’s getting closer to this idea of like, Digital selves and the fact that, like, oh, you know, you have an agent. Well, you got your matthews, you know, researcher agent who needs to, every single morning, wake up and look at these feeds and if needed, have another hit on four other feeds that might be relevant, and then summarize it this way. And then, oh, you know, oh, this month, the Harvard Business Review article came out. So go to Harvard Business Review, actually understand, and read these things to figure out what’s relevant and still an ethically responsible way to then compile that for Matthew so that when he gets in his office at 830 in the morning on February 4, 2025, he’s essentially got an agent that has done all of these things that he didn’t have to pay RPA developer to go program a workflow. I think that’s sort of the future you’re talking about there 100%.\n🌴 Brian\nAnd I think that just for a little glimpse of what I see is coming is something. And this is something I started actually working on, on a separate project that fizzled out. But I think the idea is still there. And that is a smart inbox. So by having these actions, it’d be somewhat trivial to just say, now that you have that ability to get the content from Twitter, just say now. Check it every hour or something. As long as the application’s running, it can check at whatever cadence you want it to check and then pull content into the system. So then, very similar to how you have the Smart Connections pane that shows you similar content, we create a new game that is designed to prioritize based on what you know, what’s out there and what’s most relevant to you at this exact moment. And that, I think, is probably the culmination of all of the architecture changes that I’ve been working on. It’s to provide a feature like that.\nStefano Coppo\nYeah, Brian, that makes sense. That is brilliant. And the last point on messaging coming from my background, you know, knowledge gets locked into.\n🌴 Brian\nStefano, I think we lost you folder.\nMatthew Oatts\nOh, am I there? Maybe he’s back.\n🌴 Brian\nYeah, you’re back.\nStefano Coppo\nYeah. I think that last point of the mailbox, access the browser. I think that’s brilliant. So Smart Connects based on a chromium browser. It solves the problem of authentication against all these locks. Subscribe sites like Medium.com where I have a bunch of articles that I’ve bookmarked and put in my library. I have all these emails in certain folders that get forgotten and siloed away. And now I could, and a lot of the legacy products are kind of a pre designed workflow. It’s linear. First you go here, then you go here, follow up with this, stop in the workflow and then I want to schedule it. And it’s very manual, but if I could just let chat, GPT or some AI model, help me decide or just give it an instruction, you know, check this folder or check my medium, and I start gathering all these knowledge tidbits from different sources, aggregating them into my second brain, and then decide what I want to do with it.\nMatthew Oatts\nYeah, I know we’re a little bit over time here, but what’s interesting, I had a conversation I probably washington ten years ago when I stumbled upon the idea of something that’s been going on for, you know, hundreds if not thousands of years. But I was like, wait, there’s a job role called a chief of staff. Like, I heard of like chief of staff and like politics. But like I was, I encountered this ten years ago. Like corporations have chief of staff. And I talked to somebody who had a chief of staff. He’s like, for, you know, hundreds, probably thousands of years as you move up the scale of efficiency, but also responsibility and authority and power, like it’s been figured out that you need to have, you know, the term, like right hand man, right hand woman. Like you need to have people that you can delegate to and follow alongside you just because the sheer scale and stakes are that much higher as from an organization or a systems perspective, you go up the top and I think what you’re trying to do is almost like democratize or flatten the idea of having digital chiefs of staff. That yes, there’s the digital self, digital brain, but the world is getting so complex that we’re all sort of humans propped up against something that’s getting even more and more and more and more complex, that it’s a proven pattern for a thousand years that people with great responsibility or great power probably have people alongside them that are helping them do the thing. That’s what I’m picking up on, sort of like with your vision.\n🌴 Brian\nThat’s cool. That’s a very, very interesting way to put it. I like it. It reminds me, I’m pretty sure it was. Like Charlie Munger, you know, you know, somebody that, you know, writes, you know, they say, like, you, you know, somebody in a higher position just needs somebody to also just, like, filter out all the bullshit from people, you know? So.\n🌴 Brian\nAnd I imagine that could be like the, you know, smart inbox. And in that same vein, also, how the inbox could actually help fight the misinformation problem, because the misinformation problem is not that this, you know, misinformation just exists. The problem is, is that it’s in front of you and taking your attention. But, you know, it’s. It’s very possible that if you just have the things that are most important to you right up front, then the misinformation just doesn’t even make it into your, you know, into your mind space. And then, you know, that really just reduces that effect.\nMatthew Oatts\nYeah, I can’t help it. I know we’re over time here, but I want to show you, and I do call, but I have to show you this because what you just described hits on something. I was consulting with a client earlier. Let’s see, I can find this earlier this week. I don’t know if you’re familiar with. Let me get rid of this here. Oh, the scale is messed up here. I don’t know if you’re familiar with Stephen Covey’s seven habits of highly effective people, but he talks about, he has a quadrant around, like, the important, not important and urgent matrix. The idea that we sort of have to do some of the stuff over here, quadrant four is stuff you just essentially always want to avoid. And the best way to keep getting more and more effective is try to shift stuff out of, like, kill stuff in three and use that time in two. So the idea of actually using time on important, not urgent things. And so a way to look at it from, like, return on your time is you get more return on your time working in quadrant two, this top right thing. And, you know, I use this frame a ton, just talk about sort of the different patterns of how that effect works. But I added it to our little Smart Connections thing here. Yeah, thanks for that. Yeah. But I. Cause I think that’s what you’re trying to do is like, you’re trying to have essentially an agent that can handle some of this quadrant three stuff and, you know, so that you can free up time to actually do more, like higher order thinking, important, not urgent work, which is kind of neat.\n🌴 Brian\nSo. Yeah, I think definitely, yeah. I mean, I could talk all day about this, but I know we’re already over time. I appreciate you guys, you know, spending the extra time and, you know, for contributing. It makes a big difference, so. And. And thanks again, Matthew, for organizing these.\nMatthew Oatts\nYeah, my pleasure. This is. This was great. I just realized I forgot to actually. Capture the full recording, which is not that big a deal because the grain thing is here, too. So because we had no unsavory interruptions, I will very quickly be able to just post the chat clips from this one. I’m probably just going to ignore last week’s and then make sure I prioritize getting this one out sooner rather than later. So that, because I know you want to share some of this stuff out, too. So I’ll get that stuff done today in a day and I’ll post it in the lean coffee channel.\n🌴 Brian\nThat’s awesome.\nStefano Coppo\nBrian and Matthew, thank you both. One burning question for our viewers, though. I know Brian is with the ceiling fan, the colorful shirt, you know, the coconut trees you have in your icons. I’m trying to pinpoint your location.\nMatthew Oatts\nIs it, I guess, wrong? Stefano, the first time I did it, I guess wrong.\nStefano Coppo\nOkay, so I, you know, Hawaii comes to mind. Me being a West coast kid, having visited Florida several times, there’s that thought, Caribbean, some island that you own. So I don’t know what it is, but, you know, I don’t have my ceiling fan on in my house this morning.\n🌴 Brian\nSo, yeah, that ceiling fan is basically on permanently. So is the one in front of me. And that’s because here in St. Petersburg, Florida, it is just constantly hot. You know, there’s, there’s a month out of the year where it’s too cold. And then for the rest of the year, I walk outside and I have a good habit of just quick rinsing off in the shower because it’s the only way to, you know, survive. You need to rinse off all that sweat that you’re undoubtedly going to pull. But, yeah, St. Petersburg, Florida, I can’t say enough good things about it. It’s, I never lived somewhere that I loved as much as St. Petersburg. You know, it’s, it’s great here. And I think a lot of people are discovering it. The, the prices are going crazy. I live in this little condo right on the water. You know, I’ll just, I’ll do a quick, I don’t know if you can see out my window there, but there’s like a bunch of boats out there, I guess because we’re ahead. I have this, I guess, I don’t know. I don’t want to mess around and waste more time by unblurring. But I’ve got a canal there with dolphins that come by. I basically do all of my thinking out by the bay, Tampa Bay. It’s just beautiful. I’m out there at sunrise I’m out there at sunset walking around for my stack of note cards, just thinking about these things. I come in here, get them dumped into my Obsidian, and start working my way through figuring out what’s next. And honestly, the reason why I’m just going on about this is because I think to myself sometimes I’m like, who the hell are you to think that? Can do what you’re doing. And then I think to myself, who better to try to empower individuals with these tools than somebody who just is like, you know, also an individual trying to empower themselves and somebody who’s been fortunate enough to live in a place where they just love doing it.\n🌴 Brian\nAnd that’s all I have to say about it, about location.\nStefano Coppo\nWell, we’re great.\nMatthew Oatts\nWe’re grateful. We are grateful, for sure.\n🌴 Brian\nI appreciate it. Well, I’m grateful for you guys.\nMatthew Oatts\nAll right. See everybody later.\nStefano Coppo\nHave a great weekend. Be well. 😊🌴"},"Community-Lean-Coffee-meetings/Community-Lean-Coffee-2024-10-18":{"title":"Community Lean Coffee 2024-10-18","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\ntranscript\nMatthew Oatts\nI’ve spent a bunch of time with undergraduate students at Georgia Tech who I’ve started in a mentoring program around. And undergrads in schools these days are just still as eager beaver as they were when I was in school. Just always wanting more and more time and idea. So I see somebody here, Fran, I don’t know that we’ve met. Maybe we have or not.\nMatthew Oatts\nBut I want to be extra people join to make sure that there’s no bad actors joining because we had a little bit of a disruption one time. You did? Yeah. I wonder who unknown is. Do you want me to give it a shot, Brian? Or do you want me to hold off?\n🌴 Brian\nWhat do you think? I say go for it.\nMatthew Oatts\nOkay. Watch out, Fran. If it’s someone who is going to start displaying unacceptable content, we will hype them out as quickly as we can. Hey. Hey. All right. He’s a real person. We didn’t know who unknown was, but you look real and you look like you’re not a bad actor.\nUnknown\nSo we’re good. Thank you. I signed up with a different email address, but then due to Google things, I was logged in. Okay, cool.\nMatthew Oatts\nI’m Matthew, by the way, obviously. Brian there. And then we got others joining here. Fran, is it Fran or Fran?\nFran Abenza\nFran. Fran. Yeah, whatever. Actually, yeah. Quickly, I must admit that I won’t be able to participate now much. I’m in a hotel there. Like, there is dinner and the father of my girlfriend was like, not too happy about me doing the call at the same time. So I will just, like, quickly drop by here. You know what would be awesome for me? Can I. Can I get to know what is the agenda? Or can I actually watch this later?\nMatthew Oatts\nYes, absolutely. So go back to your dinner and spend time with real people and not us virtual people. It’s going to be recorded. You see an AI agent there that’s not only going to record it, but organize the recording for you to be able to watch it later. So, yeah, do that. And yeah, go enjoy time with real humans. And I’ll make sure that you get. There’ll be a Miro board and I’ll even post it in the lean coffee stuff. We’ll make sure you get access to all that information.\nFran Abenza\nThanks a lot. Yeah, if you can later send to me, Brian, via, like the link via maybe Twitter or something, it’d be awesome.\n🌴 Brian\nOkay. Yeah, I’ll definitely touch base with you about that.\nFran Abenza\nThanks. Otherwise, I’ll ask later. Thanks a lot.\nMatthew Oatts\nThanks. Okay. All right, I see Tapmab. I’m going to admit them too. Again. We’re going to, we’re going to wing it here, see who joins.\nTap mab\nHi there.\nMatthew Oatts\nHi there. Welcome. Oh, got an echo. All right, let’s go ahead and get started here. I’m going to mute whoever that was. Make a viewer. Oh, there we go. There we go. Sweet. All right, I’ll start my screen. So how many people are new? I think there might be a couple new folks here to the lean coffee. For folks that are new. Are you new to the concept of a lean coffee or just to this one? You heard of Lean Coffee?\nUnknown\nI’m new to both.\nMatthew Oatts\nSweet.\nTap mab\nAll right, same here, Matthew.\nMatthew Oatts\nOkay, great. Well, let me show you this. By the way, I’m Matthew Oates. I am a. I’ve been in the orbit of Brian and his awesome plugins for a while, but I decided to lean into the community to help facilitate connection around people, because I’m not going to actually be able to, like, do any coding contribution or anything like that. But what the lean coffee is, is essentially. And I’ll put the link in the chat for folks. What this is, is just a space for us to come together and share ideas and for, you know, see anyone with the link, copy board link to share ideas, have conversation, communication. Maybe pick Brian’s head a little bit as we learn about new things that are either in. That are Smart Connections or maybe Smart Connections adjacent. And so. Yeah, so we do that. The structure of a lean coffee is pretty straightforward. And so I’ll explain that and then let’s do this. What is today? Today is the 18th. Let me get some of these things. Structure of a lean coffee is relatively straightforward. What we do is there’s sort of. There’s a cadence where this is all emergent ideas of what we want to talk about. So, by the way, is it. Is it names wise, so I can refer to people we got. Is it tap?\nTap mab\nYeah, it’s just tap.\nMatthew Oatts\nTap. Okay. And then I know it’s. I know your name’s not unknown. Sorry, what was your name again? I forgot that. Catch it. Auden.\nUnknown\nOkay, cool.\nMatthew Oatts\nAuden. Tap Brian myself. So what we’re going to do is, essentially, we’re going to spend some time, because you all have spent the time committed to be here. We get to prioritize what we want to talk about. The idea of a lean coffee is we come up with topics and ideas. We’ll sort of put them in a board of things that we can prioritize. And then as a group, we’ll sort of vote on what’s the most important thing that we want to talk about. That’s what’s important to us. And then we’ll have some time to talk about that thing. And then once we talk about it, We’ll move that off, sort of. If you’re familiar with like a Kanban thing or like progressive tasks stuff, we’ll move that topic off and we’ll, we’ll talk about the next topic. So it allows us to really, as a group, talk about things that we want to talk about and that we prioritize. Brian, did you have anything else you wanted to add before we hop into that cadence?\n🌴 Brian\nNo, all sounds good to me. Thanks for facilitating.\nMatthew Oatts\nCool. All right, so I’m going to start a timer here. And Brian, I am sorry, refresh me. Are we doing more technical stuff today or non technical?\n🌴 Brian\nI say we just do free for all. Whatever anybody has questions about, just put them up there and we’ll do the vote if we have enough questions and see how it goes.\nMatthew Oatts\nAll right, sounds good. I’m going to start a timer for four minutes. You can hop into the mirror board. If you have trouble, you can just let me know. Also, stop sharing my screen, but I’m happy to, actually, I’ll share it for a little bit so people can sort of see what’s going on, and we’ll do that. So if you’re not familiar with Miro, sort of like an infinite whiteboarding tool, so you can select a post it notes. I actually have a topic on mind comparing notebook ln to our usage of Smart Connections and Obsidian. Notebook ln has been like a topic of conversation for colleagues and people in my ecosystem a lot lately, and so I want to pick y’all’s brain around if you’re familiar with it. And how does it relate to Obsidian and how you use Smart Connections?\n🌴 Brian\nYeah, that’s a good one.\nMatthew Oatts\nAnd then other topics. What’s that thing? Yeah, feel free to just hop in, folks, into stickies if you have topics you wanted to ask about, even obviously if it’s specific to Smart Connections too, that would be useful. I just haven’t been hands on a lot with Smart Connections lately.\nTap mab\nYeah. And Matthew, sorry, apologies. I’m also new to this setup. How do you zoom in?\nMatthew Oatts\nYou should just be able to, if you’re using the notepad, just like Zoom in and out. If that’s not working, there’s this little thing down here. You can zoom in and out. If you’re also looking for someone you could follow, for instance, I could follow Brian right now, and this is Brian’s view. You could click on my face.\nTap mab\nYou can follow there if it’s actually quite limited because I’m not able to see that I’m on a Mac, so I can’t see the bottom left.\nMatthew Oatts\nOh, strange.\nTap mab\nSo does.\n🌴 Brian\nDo you have a topic in mind and we can just add it for you?\nTap mab\nYeah, I think it was mostly just around, like, Smart Connections. So I’m definitely new to like, Obsidian and stuff. So I just saw, like, I was like, looking at your video to connect, like, because I just had the idea of just how can I combine like, folders with ChatGPT and how can I go browser? Then I saw that you came across your video and that’s when I came to in terms of, like, Smart Connection. So I just wanted to see more like, the limitations that they are so far, because I was, like, trying to change the folder name with Smart Connections and then I was not able to change the folder name, but I was able to change like, the notes within it as well. And there was also something where you had, like, Smart Connections, experimental. And I just couldn’t get that to work as well on my end. So it’s more just more just to sort of see, just to have a feeling of where they started. And because I kind of see what their vision is. Like, it’s probably almost like you. You’re trying to just like, pull off notes. It’s probably like a, what’s it, like a Javas or Tony Stark kind of thing. And yeah, I can imagine in the future you will be like hands free and just call, like, hey, can you remind me of that note? Can you update that note for me? Or based on this conversation, end up that on Obsidian acting as a second brain. So I think that’s what I kind of got the g side of it, but, yeah, please let me know.\n🌴 Brian\nOkay, so editing capabilities from within ChatGPT, does that cover, like, the topic that you’re thinking?\nTap mab\nYeah, yeah, that should be fine.\n🌴 Brian\nOkay. And if you have anything else and you can’t get in there, just let me know and I’ll, I’ll type it up.\nMatthew Oatts\nThere’s one other thing I had.\nTap mab\nAnother will be a custom, sorry, what was that time? Custom chatbot.\n🌴 Brian\nLike custom GPTs?\nTap mab\nYeah, custom gpds?\n🌴 Brian\nYeah. Okay. Yeah, I’ll make that card custom scGPTs clarified.\nMatthew Oatts\nAll right, so now what we can do as again, the group of people that have invested time in here, we get to have the authority to pick what we want to talk about. So do this. I’m gonna start a vote and I’m gonna give everybody three votes. Just stickies. Don’t need this one. You should see a joining to. There and then we’ll start that voting. And so you’ll see a thing called join voting and you can join there and that will allow you to essentially vote on topics that we’re going to talk about. All right, looks like 404 have voted. All right, so we got editing capabilities within ChatGPT, and then comparing notebook LM and then custom Smart Connection GPT is clarified. So let’s stack rank those over here. We’ll do this one is going to be the first topic and we’ll talk about these two down here. So, Brian, I think you’re probably the best person to kick off this part of the conversation. I’ll go down below and start taking notes as best I see fit, but yeah, yeah.\n🌴 Brian\nSo as far as the editing capabilities in ChatGPT are concerned, so this is going to be something that’s specific to the Smart Connect app and not the Smart Connections Obsidian plugin. So in order to use the ChatGPT with your notes, you have to have the Smart Connect app. And those editing capabilities are of course going to be limited by the progress on that application. The current state of the application is there’s this notes version one GPT, and I’d say the large majority of that code for that GPT is actually quite old. So it was one of my very first proof of concepts and prototypes that I built and I. It was really cool. It was like a really nice start. But I quickly started discovering a lot of limitations using the way I was going about the logic in that notes version one GPT. That brings us to notes version two GPT. The way the notes version two GPT works much more dependent upon the structures that you’ll see when you’re using Smart Connections. The Obsidian plugin, for example. In the Obsidian plugin, it breaks down your notes into what I’m calling blocks. So, like, another common term for that would be chunks. But I use the word blocks because chunking, it sounds a little messier than what blocks are supposed to be. Blocks are supposed to be these logical segments of content. When I imagine a chunk, I just imagine chopping up a note like every hundred words or something like that, while a block is this logical segment of the note. And when it comes to markdown, like, which is the syntax used by Obsidian, what that looks like is the headings in your note essentially become part of a file path. And like, how does that matter for editing capabilities? How that matters is when ChatGPT is looking at your notes, instead of just seeing this like, big block of text, it sees these segments, and each of those segments has what I call a key. But that key is very similar to like if you had a file path to a file. So then when the ChatGPT says, okay, I want to update this note, there’s this sentence, and it’s in a heading that is midway through the note. It’s able to say, here’s a path, or here’s the key directly to this smallest segment of the note, and then it can just rewrite that small segment of the note, rather than having to rewrite the entire note in order to change a piece. That might be minuscule compared to the length of the note. So that’s the primary paradigm shift between the notes version one GPT and the notes version two is that the notes version two is much more like the editing capabilities are baked. In to how the Smart Environment breaks down notes in order to make sense of them.\nMatthew Oatts\nSo to repeat that sort, I’m trying to attempt at doing some visuals here for you, Brian, so we can, for the visual, visual learners out there that end up watching this. Yes. Perfect. Am I close in? Like, it’s not actually. Let’s see this.\n🌴 Brian\nI mean, I definitely see where you’re going with the visuals here.\nMatthew Oatts\nHow off am I?\n🌴 Brian\nNo, I mean, I think that it’s like, definitely going in the right direction. So I don’t know if anybody here is familiar with these, like, coding AI’s like cursor, but the way cursor works is it literally goes through the entire file and reproduces the entire file with the exception. It’ll add placeholders, and then it’s similarly parsing out these placeholders in order to create a final output for editing your code. What’s going on in Smart Connections is just, I would say it takes it to, like, a lower level of granularity, and I think that that is going to add, you know, like. Like not just flexibility when it comes to editing, but this whole, like, breaking things into blocks idea. It also enables things like a change history. So in your Obsidian, like, if you’re using Obsidian sync, or if you’re familiar, like once again with code where they have like GitHub or the Git program, which helps you track change history, the idea behind blocks is that you can have this more granular level, more granular level of history. And while that has direct implications for editing in the long term, when we have a history of these edits, we can also take that and use it as context of what does a successful change look like. I want to improve my note. I have this big long note. It’s a first draft, and I want to make progress on that note. Well, there’s probably a lot of similar segments compared to other notes. For example, I like to have a heading for why does this note exist? And another heading for next actions. What are the next tasks? I need to do to move this note forward and I have these like structured sections. So what I would like to see happen, you know, as like the next step is being able to track change history based on those sections. So then when the GPT is attempting to help me make progress, it can see what did progress look like in the past, you know, so I guess that’s like, that’s a lot of my thinking behind, you know, the architecture that goes into this. Does anybody have any more questions? You know, that can kind of hopefully keep me on the rails with what you guys are interested in hearing about?\nMatthew Oatts\nOne of the things that I’m curious about is relative to like, I think a lot of folks are always interested in timing of availability of these things and we talked. I know I missed last one, but like stability of it and things like that. In terms of like the different, like pragmatically leveraging notes v two versus notes v one is like, they’re a different link that we should. Is this like the experimental one? Is that what you mean by experimental over here and like those types of things?\n🌴 Brian\nYeah. So notes V two is currently labeled as experimental. I think I’ll probably be dropping that label once the next version comes out. So I’ve been, you know, that’s been like my primary focus of the latest update I’ve been working on, which hasn’t shipped yet. But the upcoming update, there will be basically more, the features of the version two will be a lot more comparable to what’s available in version one. Right now in version two it lacks things like the alignment note, which I just re added an alignment action. And the alignment action has a little bit of extra, a little extra capabilities compared to the version one. But you know, like I didn’t do too much there because as far as alignment goes, that’s, that’s a whole sub project that I’m working on. You know, so like I wanted to bring some level of alignment like, you know, some like level of control into that version too. So I did what was pretty much like a copy and paste of the version one with the addition of a couple extras. But you know, long term as far as that alignment goes. So if you’re familiar with the Smart Connect app and setting an alignment note, basically it’s like another set of custom instructions that you can give ChatGPT to help you work through your notes. But where I see that. Transitioning into is going to be more of like an alignment folder. So while you’ll still be able to add some static custom instructions, I think what this morphs into is having an entire folder of content that while you’re interacting with the GPT, it’s just adding notes in the background, very similar to how the ChatGPT memory works. So I’m still working out the details. How are we going to. And this brings up a major principle behind all the software, which is how do I complement what OpenAI and ChatGPT and these other platforms are doing? Because I don’t want to spend my time just reproducing what they’re doing. We’re working on something that they’re going to release as a feature in the near term, or even long term for that matter. So what does this alignment folder, what would that look like if it complemented what already exists in the form of ChatGPT memory? And that’s something I’m still working through the details on. But getting back to the difference between v one and v two. V one, like I said, it’s very much legacy code. I see that you have the application brought up there, Matt. So just so you know, to get to the link for version two, you should be able to. Okay, so where it says no speed to experimental, is that clickable? That’s not clickable. Yeah. Okay. That is actually a mistake on my part. There was supposed to be a link there that would just open up the GPT. So I’m making a note to myself here, added backlink to notes v two GPT. And that’s a result of I’ve been working through the user interface architecture. Basically I just like moving fast. So the first iteration of the UIHe was not a very sustainable architecture. So I’ve recently just been rewriting all of this UI to be something that’s going to be more sustainable in the long run. And of course I’m breaking things and losing things in the process.\nMatthew Oatts\nCool. Is there a way to find the notes v two thing? One of the things that I’ve recently been struggling with. I know this is a little bit of sidebar. I’m not wanting to hijack this, but in terms of if I wanted to, actually, there’s so many different ones, I don’t know which one to use. Yeah, like, Smart Connections chat. Smart Connections note, it looks like the chat with your Obsidian notes one is like 300 plus. So is that where you’re saying the actual proper links to find out which one is going to be. Like, I could click it from here to know the right one to go to.\n🌴 Brian\nYeah. So in the previous version, there was a little, like, you know, like that, like where it said notes experimental. That was clickable, you know, so I just. That just got lost in the. In the update, you know, the last update, which pushed a bunch of new UI stuff, you know, like, as far as, like, where you would find that link. Like, I could give you the link right now, but I’ll say you’ll just want to wait until the next version where the link will be there anyway, because, so, like, I’ve been, you know, like, I’ve been working on that notes version two, except for the. The actual version two, like. Like, where that link would take you is not updated yet. I’ve had to work using one of these custom GPTs, which is also, you know, like, so I know there was a question about the custom GPTs in here. You know, basically I’ve been. I basically just copied that experimental notes GPT into a custom GPT and I started updating it from there, my local version. Version. And that will all be moved over to the publicly available notes v two GPT upon the next release of the software,\nMatthew Oatts\nwhich before we move on to this next topic, I want to check in with folks, and I also want to clarify something that took me a while when I first started to get involved in Smart Connections. And what is the difference between Smart Connections and Smart Connect app and all those types of things for those watching the recording, or both of you guys that are on this call, and Brian, correct me if I explain this incorrectly, but there is Smart Connections in Obsidian, which is essentially a plugin within Obsidian, and that’s where you can have, within an Obsidian panel, chats using your open AI, whatever key you have, whatever LLM you connect it to chats within Obsidian with relative to your notes, and it does embeddings. You’ll see it open up with the plugin and it’ll do all the embeddings there. Separate from that, there is the smart. I don’t know how you brand it, but either the Smart Connections with ChatGPT, or I guess that’s probably smart. Is it smart? Do you call it Smart Connections with chat\n🌴 Brian\nas far as the app is concerned? I’m just calling it Smart Connect right now, but I do apologize. Yeah, the naming is a bit of a mess, yes.\nMatthew Oatts\nSo there’s the Smart Connections Obsidian plugin, which is essentially the thing that allows you to have an Obsidian plugin and use your key to actually interact with nodes within Obsidian. Then there is a ChatGPT tool, which is what we were just showing, which gives you the ability within ChatGPT to have a conversation with ChatGPT and directly engage and edit your notes. That’s the thing that requires the Smart Connect app, which is like my understanding, is pretty much like a local server that helps connect the ChatGPT like actions infrastructure and that sort of architecture with your actual notes saved on your local computer. So if you’re confused at all between, wait, what is this app thing? And you’re just a Smart Connections with Obsidian plugin user, they’re sort of two different but related products that have similar roadmaps.\n🌴 Brian\nSo I think I can add a little bit there. Like everything you said is 100% correct. I think I can add a little context about why are there multiple apps or plugins here. So the underlying concept that both of these pieces of software implement is what I’m calling a Smart Environment. And a Smart Environment is essentially a wrapper for your local data that enables you to control how AI interacts with your data. So as far as the Obsidian plugin goes, it’s essentially a window into your Smart Environment. Where the Smart Connections name comes from is that there’s this Smart Connections view, which takes the data from within your Smart Environment and says, hey, based on what you’re currently looking at, this is probably most relevant using AI embeddings. So that’s where the Smart Connections name came from. But really what that plugin is doing, it’s just tapping into your local Smart Environment. Then we have the Smart Connect app, which very similarly connects into your local Smart Environment. How that works, how they’re connecting into the same thing, is that they’re both using the same underlying settings. There’s this Smart Environment configuration file. So when you’re changing the settings, whether in the app or in the Obsidian plugin, they’re both updating the same. Smart Environment configuration file, and that defines what data is accessible. And then in the Smart Connect app, it also defines what actions are available. So in the Obsidian plugin, it’s essentially read only. While the Smart Connect app brings in these extra editing features and the Smart Environment, the design is to give you control of what the AI is able to read, what it is able to edit. I hope that added a little bit of context around what these two pieces of software do. Something I left out is the Smart Chat. The Smart Chat was an additional feature that came into the Smart Connections Obsidian plugin. It’s something I’m working on a major rewrite for right now to bring it up to speed with a lot of the other architecture decisions I’ve made since initially releasing that chat. At the end of that, the Smart Chat will actually become its own plugin. Then this way we have the Smart Connections plugin. It’s specifically for showing you what connections exist to your current content. Then there will be the Smart Chat plugin, which enables you to chat with your notes. Both of these share all the same underlying internals, so it won’t be reloading the same things. It’s the way the software just designed is to reuse those same internals. And if you’re interested in the code, all of these, pretty much all of the code is available in the JSBrainss repository. On my GitHub. I break down all of the pieces into these reusable components. They get reused. The things in Obsidian get reused in the application, the Smart Connect app. I expect that the Smart Chat will be available hopefully by the end of the year in the Smart Connect app. And what that will allow you to do is to work having the same capabilities as ChatGPT gives you, but using APIs, maybe you’re using anthropic or Google’s API or even local models to utilize the actions and capabilities from the Smart Connect app. And you know, That also includes bringing the capabilities from the Smart Connect app into the Smart Chat plugin for Obsidian.\nMatthew Oatts\nI’m going to see if I can repeat back because I found that useful to understand the context there. Brian, am I still sharing my screen? Yeah. All right, so if you look at, like, we see how close I am here, and then I do this, this, this, this got your actual grabs one, right? So is this close in the sense that the, if I repeat back what I was just hearing, you have your Obsidian markdown files, which are essentially middle files here. And if you start to build an architecture that sort of can access those files and create a Smart Environment, sort of wrapping all of those files, these are still like those Obsidian files here. And then if you still have the. Obviously the UI with Obsidian, you can just use the UI to access your notes, and that’s no plugin necessary. But when you add this idea of a Smart Environment, and then you have your Smart Connect app, you have the ability to, and you don’t necessarily even have to have the Smart Connect app. There’s an optionality where you just like, the orange thing is, you just go straight to the Smart Environment. You don’t even need to Smart Connect path. But the idea is folks that have encountered this ecosystem, maybe simply encountered it because they saw Smart Connections as an Obsidian plugin. I bet you that’s probably the most common entry point into what the heck we’re talking about. And so they download the Smart Connection subsidian plugin underneath the covers. All the subsidian plugin is leveraging a wrapper around their notes that allows you to get some interesting visual insights into how some of your notes are related, and that’s how you’re handling all your embeddings and stuff here. And then you also have this cool little tool where you can have a Smart Chat leveraging the same kind of stuff, and you can go to the Smart Environment stuff that you’ve built underneath the covers. And so I would say probably the vast majority of people that interact with anything Smart Connection ecosystem related, just download the plugin and there. They’re doing that and they get their little list of how closely related these connections are. And that’s neat. And then at some point, they encounter this idea of, oh, wait a second, there’s a way I can actually leverage ChatGPT to update and change my notes, edit notes, and so what that is, well, that’s a sort of a different part of the architecture. That’s part of the architecture that one definitely requires this Smart Connect app. So you have to essentially have this app, that app is running on your local environment, because that’s the thing that you need to have access to actually leverage ChatGPT’s actions architecture to be able to interact with different things. You can interact with notes there. That’s what gives you the ability to have a ChatGPT window, to do something with your notes, to update it. Let me see if I can find a decent example of this that I did the other day. So, so one of the things that I do, and I had to update it, and it’s sort of not working, but it’s besides the point. I. I like to sometimes exactly find in my Obsidian without sharing all of my secrets. Give me 1 second here. Not that I don’t have a lot of secrets. All right, so I have a implementation of this architecture. And by the way, is this useful like this? I’m sort of going off on a tint, like, hijacking the conversation, but I’m seeing some nods that this is useful to at least talk about.\n🌴 Brian\nSo.\nMatthew Oatts\nYeah, okay, cool. One of the things that I do, and I’m okay with doing this. Yeah, okay, cool. So here’s my Obsidian vault. I’m gonna have to be super confident that I don’t give away any, like, private stuff. But one of the things that I have done is I like to use Smart Connections, and this is me actually testing something. Let me see. I don’t know if I can have. Let me go back to some older variables real fast. Doesn’t work. I like to. Let me see if I can actually find this article. Here’s like a local consulting firm. I’ve broken it, but here’s the idea. Imagine you encounter a blog post where it’s just a blog post, an interesting blog post. What I like to do is have a Smart Connections conversation in ChatGPT. To have ChatGPT essentially summarize that article and then generate a note for me that creates a note in my vault, my Obsidian vault, that has a summary of the article that maybe also starts with some backlinks that would be useful to create in the future and then give me the source file so I can sort of have it sort. Be an archivist of things that I do that improves pocket like use over like pocket or other sort of bookmarking tools. So I have set up Smart Connections, and again, this is not the blue, this is now getting into the green world. I’ve set up Smart Connections. I have the Smart Connect app running, and so I have a conversation in ChatGPT, and then I give it instructions on what I want it to do. So summarize the article. If it’s over 500 words, reduce it down to 75% of its length. If it’s over, or if it’s under 500 words, just sort of keep it the same. If it’s over, have it be 50% of the lengths, or shorten it. Include some important topics, like extract out from this some insight that you might have as to what are important key topics from the article. Retain the URL that I give you, create a new note or the link, and then put it in a particular folder. So what this is essentially doing is turning ChatGPT with Smart Connections into an archivist of things that I encounter, and it puts it in a specific folder. So for instance, this article, and this is what that’s done, is essentially, hey, here’s this thing that I found. It’s highlighting the article and it’s giving me links so that if, for instance, technical debt happened to also be a note that I had in my vault, that could do that. But I tend to do this for, and I actually did this one AI overhyped. Here is something that somebody published on LinkedIn. It summarized it, I added some own notes myself. And so I essentially have, I’m leveraging Smart Connections to automatically build notes, and we can try to see if this actually works here. On another note, like, I really like this large language model here. Here’s a good article that I encountered the other day. It was just a good explainer of large language models and how they work and that type of thing. So if I do this, the idea here is like, notice that why tech modernization fails is the most recent article. I’m just going to give it another URL. I don’t know if it’s going to work or not because I haven’t been messing with this for a bit, but I’m essentially giving ChatGPT this. It’s going to go read and find the article. And this is a real pressure test, Brian, to see if it’s working out. So it’s starting the action. I could probably open my console if I need to see it working. And then, yeah, I don’t know if it’s going to work or not. Oh, it’s done. There we go. Created a large language article. I sort of covered it up. It’s sort of. I missed the drama. But here it is largely language articles explained. So now here’s the article. It’s got that. It summarized it. And now if I wanted to build connections between this, I could. So that’s for folks that are new. That’s this thing that is different than the Smart Connections.\n🌴 Brian\nAnyway, yeah, thanks for sharing that example. It’s, you know, I’m constantly like, you know, working to figure out, like, how can this thing actually be valuable, you know, because, like, I don’t want it to just be a novelty, you know, like, what, what is a workflow that is going to actually produce, like, value rather than just being, oh, wow, look, it can, you know, read back my notes to me and, you know, whatever. So it’s like, it’s really cool to see how you’re actually making this useful for you.\nMatthew Oatts\nYeah. The value for me is it’s an aggregate. These are all articles that I’ve encountered since I started doing this that are just things that I just don’t have the time to actually go figure out. But I get summaries of, that’s funny that, that actually I came in with, like, an actual person, but I get summaries of different articles. And then what it does is when I have to craft, because I’m in consulting, so when I have to craft advisement material around certain things, particularly if it’s actually flagged a note that already had connections, I could start building, like, literally Smart Connections between articles that I’ve read, that I didn’t actually read, that this thing parsed for me so that I can get more value for my clients out of things that I’m multiplying the amount of connections that I can make for my clients when I give them advisement around stuff without actually having to do the work myself.\n🌴 Brian\nYeah, awesome.\nMatthew Oatts\nYeah, cool. Anyway, that was a little side quest for us there, so pause, because I’ve been talking a lot.\n🌴 Brian\nLet me just, I think I can add this in 30 seconds or less. So just to get a little bit more of an idea about why is all of this necessary? So what this is replacing is a lot of what would be happening behind the scenes if you were to use. And this might hopefully tap into another one of the topics a little bit, like open or not open, but notebook lm. So when you upload your content to notebook LM, it’s essentially creating a Smart Environment and it’s providing all of these different functions to interact with. That content that you uploaded to their servers, except for the differences, is all of that is on some third party server somewhere. And what I’m working on is building something that you can be confident in. The data that you’re sharing with AI is done, so on your terms. And you don’t have to just be thinking that, oh, all of my proprietary information is now sitting on some server somewhere just waiting to be accessed by the next hacker or whatever, or even the company themselves, trying to utilize your data for their own profits.\nMatthew Oatts\nYeah. And I think that’s the thing for me, too, that just drew me to this, like, for instance. And I’m going to do it because I don’t actually particularly care, but I’m going to let me create something and I’m going to take some of my own proprietary content from my consulting firm around some things. So I will, oh, I just did this. And I’m just, I’m using this example. Does it sort of add some context to what you’re saying? So I just did a presentation to some folks at Georgia Tech. So technically, in theory, I’ve already given it away, but it’s a presentation around what is consulting and perspectives around. So this is technically my proprietary information around points of view around, and it’s not important. So it’s not that big a deal. But imagine if it was client proprietary information or, or something. The idea here is if I were to drop that content into this and then I were to maybe pick some other things from my vault of things, maybe there’s an interesting HBR article. So where else do I put stuff in here? Sources? Do I add more? So I’m going to add like a Harvard Business review article. So now I’m starting, when people use AI, you’re starting to now breach like a little bit of that ethics boundaries as to whether or not I really should be uploading a Harvard Business review article to a thing if I don’t know actually where it’s going to go. And then here’s an interesting article that I reference a lot about the autonomous enterprise of the future. So the idea of what I’m doing right now, real time in notebook lnzenhe, is if I’m understanding oop, I keep not doing that to make your point. I’ve just had, I’ve essentially given away, technically the rights to full control. I’m essentially having to trust Google that they’re not going to do anything with these and protect this information. To be able to have this set of sources, that’s going to give me something. So if I wanted to say, please prepare a TED talk on the sources. It’s essentially having to do all this stuff, but it owns that information. So Brian not owns, but they have access to the information. So Brian is essentially your vision for Smart Connections about. I already had that stuff on my own local environment. Keep it on my local environment. I know what I’m doing with it and I’m just applying everything else between what I just did, you know, all of the features that are in notebook lm, you’re looking to have everything, but in a saved in a safer space that you have more control over.\n🌴 Brian\nMaybe not everything. I think that is 100%. Like one of the beneficial side effects of, of the whole system. But I think it actually, you know, will go a step further to the point where eventually the, the amount of data necessary to maximize AI’s ability to help you as an individual, I think that that amount of data is actually going to cross a threshold where it no longer becomes possible, or at least practical for Google to provide these services, because right now it’s essentially zero cost. You’re not paying Google to use notebook Lm. I think that we’re going to hit a threshold where having the data locally, so there’s like, what you can imagine as like a pre processing layer. So, like, the AI does its processing, like the AI we’re all used to interacting with. But there could be this other layer which I imagine is going to look more like a reinforcement learning system than the large language models. That’s like a specific type of AI network. And a reinforcement learning system is separate. I think that it’s going to become increasingly difficult for a company to manage the necessary data all on servers because there just ends up being so much processing required that it just, like, it starts to make more sense to just have that happen locally instead of like, you know, like, like, basically what Google does is they put the information that’s not accessed a lot into what they would call, like, cold storage, storage that takes a while to read from. So, like, while in theory they could easily store, you know, tons and tons of data, but it then it becomes an issue of, like, how quickly can that data be accessed? And then now all of a sudden, like, if you’re relying on Google for that, you ask the AI a question and it literally could take minutes in order to process all that information. While if it’s on your local computer without even getting any fancy hardware, you have access to all of this RAM. And RAM allows you to access data at, like, I just happened to stumble across a diagram, like, in the past day or so, where it was like, basically millions of pieces of data can be accessed in the time it takes to access one piece of data. When you’re comparing hard disk storage versus ramp, so basically you’re taking advantage of having that. Easily accessible memory to augment and improve the AI. And, you know, while with the tools like that are currently available in Smart Connections and Smart Connect, you know, we’re just talking very rudimentary retrieval and some editing. While that doesn’t necessarily, like, hit this threshold, you know, by itself, you know, like, I’m really still working on the foundations of what I see as a lot more of like, intelligent types of processing being layered into this Smart Environment, you know, so I’ve mentioned reinforcement learning, and that’s like, that’s one of my main focuses is like, what is that like? Because that’ll be like one of the next layers that gets added in, you know, like, what does that look like? And that I think will, you know, it’ll probably exponentially increase the amount of processing even happening, like, in the Smart Environment, you know, and when it comes to having that all happening on servers, like, it’s. It’s much easier to exponentially increase your processing locally than it is when you have millions of people trying to access via the same servers. It’s just like, it’s a different calculation. And I think it’s one that even I’d be surprised if a company like Google doesn’t start offloading some of this processing in the future via local applications.\nMatthew Oatts\nWell, I know we took a bunch of side quests today with the lean coffee, but hopefully it was some sort of like useful engagement. I don’t know that we. I know a lot of times people will join the lean coffee hoping it become. Hoping it can be like a little bit of a troubleshooting forum. And we tend to not go that direction just because we want to talk more about the bigger picture concepts. And also it’s intentional from a community perspective that we do as much of the troubleshooting as we can out in the open. So we can even enlist people other than Brian to solve the problem, or we can all encounter solutions to things that we probably else other people are encountering. So we tend to sort of do that a little bit more where we don’t do a lot of the troubleshooting, these calls. So if we didn’t get to some of those things, we can. We have a pretty vibrant community that’ll help engage in that. Are there any other sort of questions or things we want to hit on?\nUnknown\nI’d just like to thank you for the meeting. It was interesting to learn a bit more in an area that’s still a bit diffused to me. So I came, as you mentioned, Matthew, to Smart Connections via Obsidian. So I’ve been listening and learning.\nMatthew Oatts\nSo thank you very much.\n🌴 Brian\nCool. Thanks for joining.\nMatthew Oatts\nYeah, I know we might not have gotten to all your questions either, but.\nTap mab\nYeah, that’s so good. Just sort of, it’s good to sort of get a framework and just sort of pick your brains. Hearing Brian speak from his perspective and your perspective as well, Matthew, as well. Yeah, I think it’s. Yeah, I’m more than happy to join. I think I’m just going to have to read the forum as well, because I just saw it today. So I’ll probably just go in depth, having understanding the forum, but at least I know having an idea. I think the only thing I was kind of confused was probably just like, when the API keys activated, like, when it reads, when the model reads, is it reading like, does it read the whole, like, if I had like 10,000 notes, does it go over and read all the notes, or is it able to sort of pick the relevant notes? So that’s probably, I didn’t get an understanding of how it’s actually capturing those notes.\n🌴 Brian\nI can answer that real quick. Basically, the local processing that I was mentioning just a minute ago, that is what is going to find the relevant notes. So this way, all 10,000 of your notes are not being sent to the server, and instead it actually reduces that to maybe ten notes that it considers as most relevant.\nMatthew Oatts\nThat’s a common question that a lot of people have, is like, oh my gosh, openapis. Is my bill just going to start going skyrocket? And it’s been designed to not have that big of impact on it. I mean, there is an impact. My understanding, Brian, is one of the drivers as to why you sort of wanted to create the green path was so that people could not necessarily use Openapi or your calls to interact with your notes. Because essentially, if you have a subscription, you get as many calls as you want for free until you get throttled. So that’s one of the big appeals why you start seeing people sometimes go this direction. Like, for instance, I’ve paid for this path and I have a ChatGPT pro subscription. I have not used Smart Connections Obsidian plugin nearly as much as I used to, because I interact more with it through ChatGPT, where I don’t have to worry about throttle. And again, I was, I used it extensively, and it wasn’t a high bill at all for, like, the calls, because it’s designed the way Brian described.\n🌴 Brian\nBut anyway, yeah, that’s correct.\nTap mab\nOkay. Yeah, because I think I put the two of them because I got the green path and have the blue one, but I think I’ve just been using interchangeably. But I think I’ll have a read and just go through the green one like what you’re saying.\nMatthew Oatts\nCool. All right, sounds good. I’m going to put the recording details. The 6th person on this is my AI bot that I use to capture recordings. So you’re going to see in that little green box down below, you’re going to see a link to the recording and then links to the different types of parts of the conversation. So you’ll be able to quickly go back and look at different parts of this conversation. Here. Like, if you click on, you know, one of these kind of things, it’ll go to a little thing here, and it’ll talk about that with the transcript. So if you want to go back and review anything that we talked about, you’ll have a nice, easy way to see that on this mirror board, and we’ll post that information as well.\n🌴 Brian\nThank you, Matt, for facilitating. I really appreciate it.\nMatthew Oatts\nAppreciate you guys. Take care.\nTap mab\nBye bye bye.\nOffsel Offalseller\nThank you. Bye. 😊🌴"},"Community-Lean-Coffee-meetings/Community-Lean-Coffee-2024-10-31":{"title":"Community Lean Coffee 2024-10-31","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\n🌴 Brian’s notes\nSearch in Smart Chat and Roadmap\nI’ve been working on enhancing the Smart Chat functionality within Obsidian. Currently, the existing version of Smart Chat is limited to single-step interactions, and it’s somewhat outdated. I’m in the process of rewriting it to allow for multi-step processes. This means that in the future, the AI will be capable of performing more complex tasks, like exploring through folders, analyzing multiple files, and providing more comprehensive insights.\nOne of the exciting features I’m planning to integrate is web search capabilities within Smart Chat. By developing Smart Actions that utilize the browser, the AI could perform searches on platforms like Google or Bing and scrape the results—all locally on your machine. This would enhance the AI’s ability to retrieve and present information without relying on third-party integrations that might compromise privacy or add dependencies.\nSmart Connections Making Third-Party Content More Useful in Obsidian\nInitially, I was quite strict about only including my own words in my Obsidian vault. The idea was to prevent clutter and keep the focus on my original thoughts, especially since Smart Connections was designed to help me keep track of them. However, as Smart Connections has improved, I’ve started to see the value in incorporating third-party content.\nWith the advancements in Smart Connections, third-party content can now be made available at the right times, enhancing the usefulness of my vault. This means that when I’m working on a topic, relevant external information can be surfaced intelligently, providing a richer context and deeper insights. It’s a shift from solely personal notes to a more integrated knowledge system that combines my thoughts with valuable external content.\nSmart Templates: “Progression Mode” vs. Progression Dimension (Data)\nI’ve been developing something I call Smart Templates. The idea is to have templates that contain prompts, which the AI can then complete to generate the desired output. Instead of the AI filling out the entire template in one go, I’m designing a “progressive template” system. This approach allows the template to be filled out step by step.\nHere’s how it works: The AI starts with the first prompt in the template, perhaps triggering a retrieval of relevant information, and fills out that section. The output from this step is then used as context for the next prompt. This iterative process continues through all sections of the template. The advantage is that it can produce better, more coherent results because each step builds upon the previous one, and the AI isn’t overwhelmed trying to process all the context at once.\nAs for the “progression mode” versus the “progression dimension,” they aim for the same outcome—improved outputs—but they function differently. The progression dimension refers to giving the AI access to the sequential history of a note—how it has evolved over time. This historical context can enhance the AI’s understanding and improve its responses.\nIn contrast, the progression mode in Smart Templates refers to the step-by-step generation of content during the template filling process. It’s about the AI’s output progression in the moment, rather than accessing past data. Both concepts can work together: the Smart Template can use the progression dimension data to inform its progressive output, leading to more refined and accurate results.\nOther Related Information\nMy overarching goal with the Smart Ecosystem is to minimize dependencies and maintain as much control over the codebase as possible, especially in the open-source components. This ensures better privacy, reduces reliance on external libraries, and allows for more seamless integration of new features.\nI’m also exploring ways to improve retrieval processes, both from a coding and prompting perspective. Effective prompting is crucial for guiding the AI to produce the desired outcomes, so any ideas or suggestions on how to better instruct the AI are always welcome.\nLastly, integrating features like root cause analysis into Smart Templates could be highly beneficial. By allowing the AI to iteratively question and refine the data inputted by the user, we can create more robust problem-solving tools within the Obsidian environment.\ntranscript\n🌴 Brian\nHey there.\nGregorio Muraca\nThank you for the app.\n🌴 Brian\nYou’re welcome. Thanks for joining us. Yes.\nMatthew Oatts\nYeah, I will take zero credit for anything Smart Connections app related. I’m only here because the best way I can contribute is to facilitate discussions so called Brian and others.\n🌴 Brian\nWell, it’s a. It’s an important contribution.\nGregorio Muraca\nYeah.\nMatthew Oatts\nAll right. I’m getting stuff set up here on my side. I realized I should be logging in this, but I’ll go ahead and post the link while we let others join. If anyone’s going to join. It all depends upon, I don’t know. Gregorio, have you watched any of the recordings before? Are you familiar with sort of how we structure some of these meetings or anything like that?\nGregorio Muraca\nNo. No. So it’s new. I’m new to this.\nMatthew Oatts\nAll right, sounds good. Well, here’s the Miro link that we hop into and I’ll share my screen. Are you familiar with the concept? I always do this sort of briefing just to make sure. Are you familiar with the concept of a lean coffee? Have you ever heard of that before? No. So it’s a meeting structure style and you can actually, I think very early on, one of the very first ones, it’s meeting structure style that’s intentionally designed to be emergent. I don’t know where somewhere in the link I’ll find it. But the idea of lean coffees is we’ll have a virtual whiteboard essentially of stickies and whoever’s on the call, essentially, if you show up, then you’re going to be a driver of what we would talk about. The idea is we have all the topics that we potentially would want to talk about. We stack, rank them and vote them and then the people on the call essentially will sort of use like a Kanban style. All right, let’s talk about this topic for 10 minutes. If we want to keep talking about it, then let’s keep talking about it. Otherwise let’s move it off the board and do the other topic. So it’s a way for us to have some degree of structure to what’s very much supposed to be an emergent engaging conversation. It’s sort of a lean coffee style. So with that I can actually go ahead and why don’t we go ahead and hop into adding more topics and I think. Brian, did you predo some of these things. Here were these ones that you added earlier in the week.\n🌴 Brian\nI was curious if you added this.\nMatthew Oatts\nI didn’t add them. I don’t know. Somebody added somebody. That’s very cool. A little bit of. Proactivity here.\n🌴 Brian\nInfo.\nMatthew Oatts\nYeah. Oh, fraun Additive. Cool. So given. I don’t know if he’s gonna join. So if he. If he doesn’t, then we’ll try to infer what is meant by those. But what I’m gonna do is start the timer here. Yeah. If you. If you right click and you go to info, you’ll see who created it if they happen to be logged in. So looks like Fran Abenza added those.\n🌴 Brian\nHe’s got some good ideas.\nMatthew Oatts\nYeah. Cool. What I’ll do is I’ll start the timer here and then whoever is on the board, we can add sticky notes and then just essentially add them and then drag them to this topics panel here and then we’ll vote on which ones we want to discuss and like in what order and that type of thing. And if you don’t have anything, that’s great. If you do have something you go ahead and add. I do have one that reaction to the new Obsidian web clipper, which obviously you saw I was very excited about. So anyway, I see got some other folks joining here. It looks like Boris has joined. Hi Boris, welcome to the meeting.\n🌴 Brian\nHey Boris, thanks for joining.\nMatthew Oatts\nI am not sure Boris is familiar with the lean coffee style meeting, but the gist of a lean coffee is we group get a list of topics that we might want to talk about and then we’ll prioritize what we want to talk about and then just talk about it. So it’s way to add a little bit of structure to what otherwise is an emergent meeting. So we’re spending time about five minutes doing that. That also buys me time to log into Miro on my iPad so I can draw if we need to.\n🌴 Brian\nAnd you can find the link in the chat, in the video or in the video call.\nBoris Smus\nI need to sign up, I guess.\nMatthew Oatts\nOh no, I don’t should. Yeah, I think I have a structured where it’s free also just so that everybody’s aware, we use an agent to record the meeting. That lets me take off the administrative effort of having like clipped parts of the meeting. So that’s what you see is the sixth participant on the call lets me in 30 seconds be able to actually capture like previous meetings with, you know, clips and tags and stuff, not have to worry about it.\n🌴 Brian\nSweet. I actually was able to come up with a blog post based on one of our last meetings using the transcripts that you provide. Yeah, and I would like to do more with the videos, you know, so if afterward, if you have any links that I can get access to, like download the videos, so then maybe I can upload them to YouTube or something.\n🌴 Brian\nI was looking around and I don’t know if I have access. I might just need a link or something.\nMatthew Oatts\nLet me look real fast. Like, it’s. There’s one video that we definitely do not have the recording for. Yeah. And just disclaimer for Gregorio and for us, there was some nefarious bots that joined this call one time and started to screen share some less than desirable audio and video that we tried to quickly kick out from the thing. So needless to say, we don’t have the recording for that meeting. So if you see people join, help me be aware of that. They made their presence known pretty quickly, but that’s okay.\nBoris Smus\nI would love to have seen\nMatthew Oatts\nthat recording and I think I do. I do have some of the recordings here. But yeah, Brian, I can give you. I might be able to give you guest access to green. So let’s see. Cool. I got. I don’t know if my eyes. 20%. Oh, and while we’re. While we’re sitting here adding things, Brian, I have. I’ve enlisted an intern who is essentially a local person. He’s in community college, going to a local. He’s about to go to a local university who I’ve known for a while, but he just wanted to get more involved in, you know, stuff that I’m doing. And I was like, I, you know, I. I can. I can’t pay you, but I can legally engage you in something that’s of benefit to you and not of benefit to me, like as a sort of an educational kind of thing. And so I started talking about what we’re doing. He’s going to get involved in this. But long and the short of it is I was like, one of the things that might be interesting is you getting involved in using this tool called Obsidian and this Smart Connections thing. And the gist of it was he was already using Obsidian. Like, I’d never talked to him about any of this. He was already using Obsidian and was already aware of Smart Connections. Oh, wow. So I was like, that’s pretty crazy. Anyway, I think his name is. So his name is Zia Nori. He might be joining some of our meetings coming up, but. He’s hopefully going to get involved too, in the community.\n🌴 Brian\nFantastic. Yeah. Just let me know if there’s any way that I could help facilitate anything.\nMatthew Oatts\nYeah, sure thing. Okay, cool. So here’s the topics and again, Boris Gregorio, what we’re going to do now is I’m going to select these topics and if you’re in the Miro board, you will be eligible. Let me just do just sticky notes that you’ll be eligible to essentially vote for which topics would be the things that you would want us to talk about. So I’m going to do three votes. We’ll do it just a minute here. And you should see now something like this on your screen where you would join voting and enjoying joining voting. You can click on what topics you’d like to talk about and then we’ll stack, rank that and use that as essentially our backlog of topics.\nGregorio Muraca\nSo we. One vote for each.\nMatthew Oatts\nYou get a three total of three votes. So pick the top three things you might want to talk about and then it’ll aggregate it.\nBoris Smus\nSo there’s a new web clipper. That’s cool.\nMatthew Oatts\nVery excited about this. I encountered this, so I’m obviously gonna go for that one, but we’ll talk about that. So be sure to vote and then the results will be tabulated.\nBoris Smus\nI don’t know what half these are. What’s an augmented conversation?\nMatthew Oatts\nWhat’s funny is someone added that who wasn’t able to join the meeting. So I don’t think any of us actually know what that means.\n🌴 Brian\nYou know, I actually think I might have an idea where he’s going with that because I’ve had some conversations with other people where it’s like, imagine having AI, so it’s like a third participant. So it’s like me and you having a conversation, but then you have AI to kind of interject. I think that might be what it means, but it seems like we’ve already got our top three.\nMatthew Oatts\nCool. We got these. That sounded interesting. So I’m just going to put that as sort of four here and then we’ll go from that since it’s all tied at three. You know, I’m just. If anyone objects to these being the three order, I think we should have plenty of time to get through all three of these topics in the next 45 minutes. So. Yeah. Okay, if we hop into this one at the top. Reaction to the new Obsidian webcover.\n🌴 Brian\nYeah. So did you want to lead on that one?\nMatthew Oatts\nAnd then.\n🌴 Brian\nYeah, let me know when like. Or how I should chime in. I mean, it’s.\nMatthew Oatts\nSure, I’ll do that. I’ll give a little bit of a demo of what I was actually tied to the thing I was talking about with new intern. So I. In a previous. So everybody knows, like, the context of why I found this incredibly interesting. In a previous Lean Coffee I had talked about, and I think it’s up here, one a scenario where I essentially would leverage the Smart Connections conversations when I would encounter something interesting on the Internet. To have Smart Connections be the tool that dumps an article into my Obsidian vault if I just give it a link. So there’s a previous video around that. But this idea of if people are familiar with like Pocket or any like URL, like archival type tool. I was talking with my intern about that and he was going to go build something that was going to essentially be a Python script that was going to scrape a website and then put it into an Obsidian article. And what we ended up realizing was, let’s see, Chrome. I’m actually going to go to chat. Where is this? Except the link chat connection is at. Yeah, What I realized is recently, I believe, and Brian, you know these folks better than I do, but is Dynalist, like the Official company behind Obsidian md, Like, if you go to like Obsidian.\n🌴 Brian\nSo that sounds familiar. So it’s probably right. But I think to your point, the person that developed this web Clipper, I believe, is also the CEO of Obsidian.\nMatthew Oatts\nOkay, cool. So anyway, and I’ll put this link into the chat here. But I was like, this is blowing my mind, the fact that from an Official party there is essentially a tool. And I’ll do this here. So let me go to like Gresky business Architecture so I can find like an article from a colleague here. Yeah, okay, cool. So here’s a blog post, like an article. Every project need this. So what this tool does. And I’ll see if I can safely bring up my Obsidian vault without disclosing private information here, I’ll just go to this. This is good enough. Here’s my Obsidian vault, like my personal vault here. What this tool does is it essentially adds an extension to Chrome where you can press this, it has formatting things that it can do and then it adds to Obsidian and it actually creates in the right folder structure, the article in an Obsidian note like boom. It just doesn’t. And what this essentially is doing for me is obviously replacing Pocket, but as a practice, one of the ways that I use Obsidian. Is to try to begin to quite literally create an archive of things that are interesting to me that I encounter trying to get them into a format where my system of record, if you will, is a bunch of markdown tiles in Obsidian. So essentially the longer, the short of that is there is an Official extension now that allows that to happen. And I just found out from another colleague that there is a mobile version of this too. And I don’t know that I have that up, but you can also get this for. Let me see if I can find it.\n🌴 Brian\nGood to know.\nMatthew Oatts\nYeah. So it is pretty slick. It works. Yeah. Here we go. Here’s this copy link. I think the big thing that impressed me. Yeah, so there’s this link too. And then I’ll leave it at this. The big thing that impressed me that we can obviously have a conversation around it is it just works. It works really, really well. Like it scrape, you know when you get like reader view on a website article, it does it to that level of fidelity. It keeps images. If you look at actually some of the settings here, you can go to options and you get all of the options around shortcuts, properties that you can have different templates. Like I was messing around with templates, you can have all sorts of stuff. So all the things that you would expect from like a really well designed Obsidian plugin are built directly into this tool. And I can, you know, I can only imagine the use cases that people are going to be encountering around either doing this manually, like when you encounter something. But I mean you can get some agents going here and deploying these kind of things and having like a really clean. You could build that into your own personal like agent, like agent, like workflow where you can just start to scrape some other things around around that. So anyway, thoughts, comments, reactions to that.\nBoris Smus\nYeah, I’ve been using a lot of Readwise and kind of have a pretty good flow. So like I have this script that just runs nicely and it takes highlights from Readwise and pulls them into my vault in Obsidian. So I feel like I got that dialed in and like the reading experience matters. I don’t really want to be reading in the Obsidian vault necessarily. So I feel like I’m not entirely sold on this, but it seems useful, especially on mobile. That would be nice.\nMatthew Oatts\nYeah, I used to use so that’s that they have like that read wise Official plugin and I used to use that a good bit because I did like Boris to your point. And if people aren’t familiar with that, if I recall correctly, what it does is essentially extract and put into Obsidian your highlights on articles, not just not the full article.\nBoris Smus\nThat’s right.\nMatthew Oatts\nYeah.\nBoris Smus\nYeah. Although actually I had my own flow that did a similar thing before. I think the, I think the Official integration does. This does pretty much what I have handwritten like a couple years ago. But that’s the other thing. I’m not sure I want the full content of an article in my vault. It’s like highly. Not like this is not what I, what I wrote, you know.\nMatthew Oatts\nOh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n🌴 Brian\nTo your point, I like I had a pretty strict rule where I would only put my own words in my Obsidian vault. Yeah. And that’s because, you know, when I first made Smart Connections, it’s because I was losing track of my own words, you know, so I thought it would just be insane for me to be copy and pasting any third party content. But then, you know, with Smart Connections getting better and you know, imagining future improvements which will make the content be available at the right times, you know, like I’m starting to open up more, you know, towards having third party words in my vault.\nBoris Smus\nInteresting. Yeah, I have some third party words. Like, I have like a, like this random thing that does like collisions. It like tries to take two random nodes and like find the synthesis between them on a nightly basis using like GPT stuff. And. But the output of that goes in a special place. It’s like nightly AI bullshit rather than polluting my corpus. So that’s my sort of, that’s how I’m trying to square that circle, I guess.\n🌴 Brian\nOh, interesting.\nBoris Smus\nSo like the stuff that’s not made by me goes in the special sequestered plays.\nMatthew Oatts\nYeah, that’s. I to your point. I think that’s, that’s naturally, I think what I’m starting to do with those things too. Like that that was going into a specific folder and Brian, this goes back to some of the conversations we’ve had that I’ve sort of struggled with in terms of using Smart Connections, being able to wisely direct Smart Connection, you know, interaction to just the things that I. That is original thought as opposed to the other articles and or incorporate other thought when I’m wanting that to happen. Like, you know, let’s say I, I want to have something that’s going to synthesize me preparing for one of my consultant meetings that needs to be exclusively only original thought and then bump that up against. All right, given this like my vocation and what I do is a lot of executive coaching and strategy and things like that. And one of the things that would be useful for me is when I have monthly one on ones with a C suite of a client. I don’t have a lot of time to talk to them about things, but I would like to drop like, hey, here’s some things over the last. 30 days that I’ve encountered that are sort of relevant to what we’ve been talking about. Being able to not just randomly go across the Internet, but instead go from my vault of articles that I’ve encountered that I didn’t necessarily have the time to read all the way through, but might be relevant to this and give me three that are relevant to drop in somebody’s inbox. Like that idea of a Smart Environment, being able to delineate those types of things is. Is neat. So by the way, just so that from a recording and perspective. And I don’t know if this is exactly Boris, how yours got structured, but this was like an old thing that I used to use from Readwise. And what Read Wise is, was that integration was able to do is essentially pull some information and then as you highlight different parts of books. Like this was like when I was reading Leadership as Language, it would essentially continue to add highlights as you added them to like Amazon. And so and the link you would get, you can actually, I think kind of see here it would go to like a lead, a Read Wise link that linked to like this was like a Kindle source.\nMatthew Oatts\nSo Morris was mentioning that that was a really nice workflow too to have that kind of stuff.\nBoris Smus\nYep, yep. Very similar to my flow as well. And I assume it captures your notes and highlights there.\nMatthew Oatts\nYeah, yeah, yeah. Gregorio, any thoughts on sort of this topic?\nGregorio Muraca\nYeah, I was searching that like because I don’t have the account. So I just realized I need to do. To open the account and then do the donation and get access to the. To do. To this extension because otherwise it doesn’t work.\nMatthew Oatts\nAnd then Smart Connect. No, this one goes to Smart Connections. You mean Miro?\nGregorio Muraca\nNo, the web Clipper.\nMatthew Oatts\nOh, I didn’t have to do a donation.\nGregorio Muraca\nWell, I don’t have the. What’s called. It says here that I need to go early access. I need to start install the early access version. So I need the Catalyst license.\nMatthew Oatts\nI see, I see what you’re saying\n🌴 Brian\nis that for the mobile app specifically.\nGregorio Muraca\nNo, for my. I have a MacBook, so.\n🌴 Brian\nSo maybe the Mac version, Windows doesn’t have this problem.\nMatthew Oatts\nI mean, I’m on a Mac right now.\nBoris Smus\nI’m on a Mac as well. There’s. I didn’t see any of that.\nGregorio Muraca\nAnd it works for you.\nMatthew Oatts\nYeah, yeah. And by the way, this is a perfect example of something that we can spend some time to work through because if you’re encountering that, then other people are going to encounter it.\nGregorio Muraca\nOr maybe I can enable Legacy mode in web clippers. Let me see.\nBoris Smus\nAre you in Chrome?\nMatthew Oatts\nAre you in Chrome? Yes. Interesting. That’s crazy. I did not encounter that. I essentially went to. Maybe Did I go to the Obsidian? Maybe I gave a bad link.\nBoris Smus\nBy the way, does Smart Chat conversation view, should that be working?\n🌴 Brian\nYeah. So are you having issues with the chat?\nBoris Smus\nYeah, I haven’t gotten it to work yet.\n🌴 Brian\nWhat error are you seeing?\nBoris Smus\nNothing, it just doesn’t. I try to chat it and it doesn’t do anything.\n🌴 Brian\nHuh.\nBoris Smus\nMaybe I need some. Is this supposed to be like local chat or do I need an API key for something?\n🌴 Brian\nSo in the top right corner there’s a little gear icon and you can add API keys or you can configure a local model but there’s no built in local chat model.\nBoris Smus\nOkay, maybe that’s it. But can I call like Olama?\n🌴 Brian\nYeah. So to do that you have to set the model platform to custom local. Okay. And then it gives you some options to configure Olama. If you search on the GitHub, there’s like a few different issues and discussions of people showing their configuration that they’ve used to make Olama work. Got it. OK. Try to search Olama on the. On the GitHub.\nBoris Smus\nOK.\nMatthew Oatts\nYeah, I’m glad Gregoro, you did you figure out sort of what the issue was? Which link were you using first of all? Was it the Chrome web Store one?\nGregorio Muraca\nYeah.\nMatthew Oatts\nYeah.\nGregorio Muraca\nSo I think now should work. Let’s see.\nMatthew Oatts\nOk. Yeah. And again, for the benefit of IT folks recording, I have not encountered any reason why it would need to be paid for. So if you’re encountering that, use caution and try to figure out how to not get. Go down a path to get it paid for. Yeah, let me see. I’m not looking like. Yeah, I’m not seeing anything there. So. Cool. All right, well let us know if we encounter any other issues with that.\nGregorio Muraca\nYeah, fine.\nMatthew Oatts\nSweet. Yeah, and I. That’s just going to personally help, I think a ton with that. Again, the big thing for me is it’s, it’s an obvious, you know, Pocket replacer. Again, if anyone watches this recording and is from Pocket, I’m not trying to like rain on your parade, but in the spirit of sort of why we all get together for both Smart Connections and then by sort of necessity Smart Connections is, you know, tied to Obsidian. One of the big drivers of people that reasons people use Obsidian is the idea of. Your information is retained by you. So like you, you’re creating a bunch of markdown files and a bunch of collateral that you own locally. And that is going to be incredibly powerful now, but then going forward. And one of the reasons I just bring up this comparison to Pocket is two things. One, you know, if I look at saves that I’ve had with within Pocket as a tool, it’s saving all of these things, but I don’t actually have the source of all of this information. Right. I don’t actually own the piece of data that’s capturing the fact that at one point in time I saved this article from Ethan Molik. I don’t have that data is stored within Pocket, so that can be frustrating. The other thing is I can’t really do much with that. And so I’m sort of beholden to Pocket as its interface. Like, I can’t tell you how much. It drives me crazy that when I go to Pocket it only shows if you look at the actual screen, like share of what I’m looking at. I’m only going to Pocket to look at the things that I’ve saved as a per. That might not always be the case, but they’re using less than 25% of the real estate to show me only three things that I’ve saved and at least 50% of things that they’re trying to get clicked through for me to click on other links. Like, as a business model, I understand why that’s the case, but as a user experience, it’s awful. So I would personally rather not behold it, be beholden to that type of experience when I just want to save an article. So obviously that’s different if it’s going into a markdown file that’s in Obsidian. So that’s why it was a big appeal to me. So anyway, that’s enough of that topic, I think.\nCharlie Potts\nYeah, I agree. Pocket sold out like five years ago\nMatthew Oatts\nwhen they started changing it like that. Charlie enters the chat and he goes, pocket sold out five years ago. I’ve never met you, Charlie, but I already like it my Pocket.\nBoris Smus\nWhy not like another clipper? Why not Rewise?\nMatthew Oatts\nI didn’t want to keep paying for Readwise and I liked Readwise experience. I just didn’t want to keep paying for it. I was a big fan of Readwise and I just was like, I don’t want to spend money. And also just like the time, energy and effort started to diminish because as people can sure to solve for my workflow, I encounter things that I don’t have the time to actually read it. And I want, as quick as possible way to essentially, with low effort as possible, drastically narrow down the Internet to things that are relevant, based upon my human experience of what I’ve encountered for potential retrieval down the road by either me or an AI agent.\n🌴 Brian\nYeah, I think there’s a lot of, like, future proofing involved too, you know, having all this as markdown. Like, not only does it make sure if that website disappears, that you still have that information, but also the markdown format is just so accessible, you know, for things like Smart Connections to parse it into useful data. And then, you know, I imagine in the future there’s just going to be more ways to manipulate that markdown. You know, to provide value to you.\nGregorio Muraca\nYes, I agree.\nMatthew Oatts\nCool. All right, next topic is web search and Smart Connections for Obsidian. I don’t know what this means. So who wants to.\nGregorio Muraca\nYes, so I wrote it. So basically let’s say you are. You are chatting with your, with the AI and then you want AI to perform acceptance search. Like yeah, if you try open. Open web UI.\nMatthew Oatts\nI’ve never heard of that.\nGregorio Muraca\nIt’s a kind of UI where you have let’s. It’s like the copy of ChatGPT. And then you can add, let’s say functionality like web search. So the model can start searching online and then you can add at some point also image generation. So ideally, let’s say you are doing something you’re reading and then you want the AI to start searching online and comes with new idea. It’s like you improve. You enlarge your database of information by asking the AI, maybe you can find connection with something external of your vault and then bring it in and say, okay, there is this this and this that you could. You should look. No, it’s about reasoning, more or less.\n🌴 Brian\nYeah.\nMatthew Oatts\nYou know, so I think Stefano maybe brought this up. Brian, did he bring this up on a previous call too? So obviously I want you to react to it, but I’m trying to connect that dot.\n🌴 Brian\nI don’t recall for sure. But as far as search in the Smart Chat, Gregorio, just so I’m clear, you’re specifically referring to the Smart Chat which is inside of Obsidian, right. And not the ChatGPT. Yeah. Okay. So, you know, because if you’re using the ChatGPT, there’s already that limited search capability that’s provided there. You know where the Smart Chat is currently is. It’s currently in a, like, it’s in a bit of an in between phase because the code there is pretty old and I’ve been working on developing a new architecture for that code so it better fits into all of the other pieces of the Smart Environment. But I did want to bring up the open Web UI that you mentioned. That is a very interesting project. And I’ve considered like, okay, should I just replace the Smart Chat with this open web ui? And you know, because it does what it does really well. It’s just I’m not sure that, you know, like, I would have to do a lot of like fitting like my current architecture to that architecture and that just adds like an extra layer, you know, so it would like remove the development of chat like. From my plate. But it would also add this development of transformations of transforming what I’m doing to fitting the Open UI or Web UI model. Basically, what I decided on is rewriting the Smart Chat so that it’ll be more amenable to future developments like integration with Smart Actions. Smart Actions are what is used by the ChatGPT GPTs to access your Obsidian. And so I know I’m kind of going all over the place here, but the point that I’m trying to get to is that I see that search functionality basically becoming a Smart Action. And there, you know, the cool part about that is that, you know, the search that would be happening would like everything else, you know, in Smart Connect and Smart Connections, it would be happening locally, you know, so I did just record a video this morning showing the first custom actions that integrate with the browser. So these actions, you know, for example, will search Twitter and then return tweets or bookmark a tweet or schedule a tweet. And I imagine that the search capabilities would, you know, follow those same patterns where, you know, there’s this new action and, you know, with the. With the new version of the Smart Chat, we will be able to utilize those actions very similar to how you can use actions and GPTs, except for those actions will be available in the Smart Chat in Obsidian. One of those actions could become a Google search, another action could become a Bing search. And, you know, we could even go further and use perplexity, because the way those actions are developed is that they’re just using the browser to run the search, to scrape the results, and all of that happens locally. So to answer your question, there will be web search in the Smart Chat. I don’t have a timeline for that. I think that it could be. The action could actually be pretty near in the future. It won’t be long to develop that action. I think the biggest part right now is I’m rewriting the Smart Chat and there’s a lot of things I want to do in that rewrite to make those conversations really deeply integrated into the Smart Environment. I think that has a lot of benefit as we move into the future where the environment can learn from your past. Conversations and you know, like, improve its outputs in the future. So like, you know, that’s why I want that deep integration versus interfacing with something like the Open Web ui.\nMatthew Oatts\nI got a question for you, Brian. I want to make sure that I’m able to orient this. And by the way, what I’m drawing from is previously in coffee, by the way, if you ever see any very rudimentary drawings, it’s likely my doing because I’m likely the least technical person on all of these calls. And so what I want to do again, to get it into Matthew’s elementary understanding of what you’re talking about, if I were to look at where like Open Web UI fits into all of this, I think what you’re essentially saying is like, there’s some architectural considerations as like, is there a link between Smart Chat plugin and Open Web ui or is actually, does that need to go more like directly here or do you not even do an integration there at all and instead evolve something about this architecture? Could you react to that, Brian? And then we’ll kick it over to Matt Parker, who has a question.\n🌴 Brian\nYes, I need to update myself with all the capabilities of Open Web ui, but I do imagine that the Smart Connect app and the Smart Actions provided there which integrate with the Smart Environment, given that Open Web UI provides a sort of functionality like GPTs, which just off the top of my head, I don’t see why a GPT type of thing, if they don’t have it already, I don’t see why it wouldn’t be on the roadmap. And basically what that means is to enable the chat to access other API endpoints in addition to whatever is built in. As long as they have that, then the Open Web UI will be compatible with the Smart Connect app. I think that there are some UI things that’s the reason why I think that I still want to have my own version of a chat, you know, so like, for, for the time being, I think, you know, like there still will be a separate chat, but I don’t see why Open Web UI wouldn’t be compatible. You know, given that they have a feature that is similar to GPTs in chat. GPT. Okay, does that answer your question?\nMatthew Oatts\nYeah, yeah, yeah. Essentially I. Yeah, I’m hearing the answer to the question is part of how you’re designing a lot of this stuff with intent is to focus on the things that you can focus on to make sure that. Compatibility with well designed other solutions is possible without necessarily catering and customizing what you’re working on to ensure that there is some integration with third party. Because ultimately that’s a slippery slope where now you’re spending a bunch of time integrating with other things as opposed to. And you know, going back, way back into the archives of our Lean Coffees. This idea of, you know, you’re trying to make sure that you’re, you’re focused more on innovation. Innovation as opposed to necessarily like integrating to an ecosystem that is so rapidly evolving that you’ll stop innovating and just end up being a third party integrator.\n🌴 Brian\nYeah, and I think to sum that up, like part of the mission of like especially the open source side of things where I’m developing these open source components, it’s to minimize dependencies. It’s like I want to have all of the code in those open source components. Unless absolutely it’s a hell yeah to include another library, for example Transformers js, which provides access to the local embedding models. I think that’s a hell yeah.\nMatthew Oatts\nCool. I know. Matt Parker, you raised your hand. What you got?\nMatt Parker\nYeah, quick question. Thanks for the chat and everything. It’s more of like a workflow question. So I use Smart Connections and Smart Visualizer, the plug, like kind of like the plugin that obviously visualizes the Smart Connections. And I’m more like asking more of like if anyone has a workflow. So I use Snip to take notes on like podcasts and books and that sort of thing. It all obviously loads into Smart Obsidian, Smart Connections. And then I’m using the visualizer to see like what notes I have obviously like link to each other and how to, how to view them. And I know, Brian, you had a video on like creating literature notes off of those notes, right? Where you’re like condensing your thoughts into that. But I struggle with like finding like I take the notes and I go through. But I struggle with like actually spending like the time to actually link and write the literature notes to like condense my understanding of whatever topic I’m looking at. So I’m wondering if anyone has any workflows or recommendations on doing that.\nMatthew Oatts\nBasically. Cool. What I’m going to do, Matt, is and you can see sort of on the board here what we’re doing is prioritizing certain topics and I’ve added another sticky to the board here so that when we get through the ones that were prioritized, we can either hit this or we can add the archive to go into the next one. Does that work for you? Definitely not. Trying to be dismissive. Want to make sure that the structure of what we’re trying to do is gives everybody the opportunity to have the things that were prioritized to get into. But I think it’s a great topic for sure.\nMatt Parker\nSounds good. Thank you so much.\nMatthew Oatts\nYeah. And then there’s a link, by the way, snip was a thing.\nMatt Parker\nYeah, the snip snip is pretty cool because it’ll take in whatever. There’s an app called Libation or Libration that downloads like the Audible books and you can load them through Snip and run AI processing on them. And then while you’re listening to them rather than through Audible, you can just like click your steering wheel or headphone and it’ll take a note of your whatever like you know section in the book that you’re reading. And you can customize the GPT like the how it does. It’s like a condensed version or long or custom. And then that all will load to Readwise and Readwise thanks to Obsidian. And then from there I use obviously Smart Connections to actually understand them, right? Because once you listen to them once, it doesn’t mean you actually learn the topic intensely. You just have a better knowledge base. But then I’m trying to follow Cal Newport’s techniques on Cal Newport’s an author that goes over a lot of studying techniques and work planning and focus block planning, things like that, but actually taking them kind of writing in your own words and developing your understanding of whatever topic you’re interested in. And then I think the cool part with Smart Connections is you can see how things web Interlake, Interlink and various books or articles you’re reading and there’s a lot of crossover that you’re those random thoughts your brain has, but you can see them with Smart Connections. Like you can literally see that same type of thing on the, on the display.\nMatthew Oatts\nVery cool. So what I’m doing is and by the way, people are probably seeing in terms of personal workflow and I encounter certain ideas. I’m demonstrating what I like to do here, which is when I learn things that I don’t know about, I often will ask Perplexity and then I will be able to copy the link to my consulting work I have become known for. If I don’t know something during a meeting, I will hijack the screen share ask it in perplexity and then give everyone in the thing the link to the perplexity so that I can create safety for people that all of us don’t have to know all of the things all the time. So here’s that someone else. I’ve linked it to this and like\nMatt Parker\nwhy, like why to take notes. And I’m like, well, you don’t know to. You don’t know. You don’t know something until you come across it. You know what I mean? Like you’re not gonna know certain topics until you like dive into them. And then obviously that’s where the Smart Chat comes in. Because you’re like, as you’re building out your thoughts on something, you could ask those questions that your lack of understanding or the gaps in something. So that’s why I was like, have you heard of Dexa AI? It’s like a podcast searching app. So if you just go to Dexa AI, it’s like a data, not database. It’s like a web face. And you can just search like, hey, Tim, what does Tim Ferriss think about this particular thing? Like, whatever question you have, and it looks through all of his. Podcasts and pulls out statements and then it’ll actually just go straight to the video, like the section of the video that he’s talking about it. And you can do like Andrew Hooperman or whatever author you’re kind of interested in.\nCharlie Potts\nThat’s really cool.\n🌴 Brian\nYeah.\nMatthew Oatts\nAll right, so I’ve taken. Thanks, Matt, for all of that decks. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.\n🌴 Brian\nYeah, thanks for joining us.\nMatthew Oatts\nYeah. So Dex, here, I’m gonna, I’m gonna just again archive some of this stuff and then we’ll be able to hop into this.\n🌴 Brian\nSo were there any more thoughts on the web search topic? No.\nMatthew Oatts\nGregorio, were you good on that one?\n🌴 Brian\nI saw a thumbs up. He’s on mute right now. Okay, cool.\nMatthew Oatts\nAll right, next topic we had talked about.\nMatthew Oatts\nDid you, did you have anything else on web search, Gregorio?\nGregorio Muraca\nYes. So I saw that you on YouTube, some video that you can build in Python, your agent, and then it does web search through Terminal.\nMatthew Oatts\nOoh, do you have a link to that so we can check that out?\nGregorio Muraca\nYes. So I was trying to post, I had a kind of file, but it doesn’t allow me to have a markdown file. Miro, let me see if I can find the link of the video. Let’s see. Yeah, if you can start going to the folder that’s the other topic.\nMatthew Oatts\nI will. Okay. Yeah, if you do that, what I’ll do is I’ll, I’ll grab that YouTube link and I’ll. Here’s this, this I saw Charlie Potts mentioned search, so I’ll add that one into this, their topic here and we’ll keep going. So, yeah, folder analysis. Who wants to kick that off while I do just keep taking notes around some stuff.\nGregorio Muraca\nSo what’s my idea? Folder analysis. Basically, I saw that you can search or you can interact with the file, but let’s say I have more files and they want. Not a summary, I want an understanding. I want an evolution of that topic that is made by, let’s say five, six files. And they want some kind of exploration like, or thinking around it. So that’s what’s the idea. Because I saw you can just link one file. So ideally because it’s an AI and it can handle multiple data. So the idea was how. How many data? Like it’s only 4096 tokens. So you can do, let’s say more like you can do, let’s say one step, two steps and then start thinking about it.\n🌴 Brian\nYeah, yeah, you know, so right now I know you’re using the Smart Chat in Obsidian and that has, you know, because it’s. Still, that old version that I told you, I’ve been working on making the next version. So that first version is frozen. There’s not going to be any more changes to that. But with the new version there will be the ability to do multiple steps. Right now, in that first version, it is just one step. So even if the AI, if it retrieves the folder structure and even if it wanted to say, okay, open up another folder and start looking through files, the Smart Chat in Obsidian is not capable of doing that right now. If you’re using the ChatGPT, those GPTs like the Notes GPT, well, ChatGPT already has the built in capability to make subsequent or execute subsequent actions. So with the, with ChatGPT, you know, you could say, you know, start exploring through my, you know, this specific folder and you know, maybe build a report on this specific topic based on my notes. How you would go about instructing the GPT to do that, that is something I’ve actually been taking a lot of notes on recently because I think that one of the, you know, like one of the big next steps in improving the results that we get from these chats is some sort of system prompt that is able to instruct the GPT to continue its search until it like finds all of the most useful information and somehow exclude the information that might have came up but is not so relevant. So is that kind of where you’re getting at, like having the GPT be able to take like a multi step process towards analyzing the contents?\nGregorio Muraca\nYeah, yeah. So you can have more than one fine interaction. Let’s see.\n🌴 Brian\nYeah, definitely. I think that just falls under improving that retrieval process. It’s definitely something I’m working on from both a code side and a prompting side. I think the prompting side is really important too. I don’t know how familiar you guys are with code, but even if you’re not familiar with code, if you have ideas about how to prompt the thing to do what you want, that’s definitely interesting to me too.\nGregorio Muraca\nYeah, so I started doing the chain of thoughts since yesterday. So as I made the kind of prompt, like a system prompt that can, let’s say, create a kind of structure in the way you approach any single prompt. So in order to have, let’s say the same. Not style, but the same thinking approach between. How do you say, generation of that of information. There is a nice online. A nice video from George Hilton. They did a conference. I’m in Toronto now. And they did a conference Monday and Tuesday. So you can find on YouTube if you write George Hilton and they talk about the risk of AI and also the advantage. And it’s nice talk. And then that’s where I start doing this about this chain of thought. He was introducing an argument like the scratch pad, thinking that I think it’s similar to chain of thought. I’ll put the link now with the other one. And yeah, it’s nice because you can. I mean, I mean it’s a new way of coding at the end because it’s a neuro nlp. No. So you give instruction and then the machine is able to perform the operation, the task by itself. So that’s super cool.\n🌴 Brian\nYeah, I do. I have a thing that I’m working on, depending on how much you follow my work. Like something that I’ve been working on is what I call smart templates. And a smart template is basically like imagine having a template with prompts in it and each prompt is completed by the AI to output the output of the template. It’s like a template that gets filled out by AI. But I think I’ve been designing it is so that it can actually be a workflow. Even though it’s like a template, you draft this template. Imagine the template was like a standard operating procedure sop. Then instead of having that template generated all at once by just one response from the AI. What I’m anticipating calling it is a progressive template. Or using, say if you’re making the template in markdown using frontmatter to define that the template should be outputted progressively. What that would do is instead of outputting the results of all the prompts in the template all at once, it would start with the first prompt. That prompt could trigger a retrieval, and then it would output into that first section of the template and then feed that output into the context for the subsequent prompt. It would do that for all of the sections of the template, which I imagine would provide a better output. Instead of just trying to come up with all the context at once and then outputting. For all of these prompts all at one time because it would be this like progressive or iterative approach.\nMatthew Oatts\nIs that by the way, did I find these right links here?\n🌴 Brian\nWhat’s that?\nMatthew Oatts\nDid I find the right links here? As you were talking, I was trying to bring up some of these things. So like I see you have a video here. Is that what you’re talking about?\n🌴 Brian\nSo yeah, that’s the very start. So like what’s out there? So there is an Obsidian plugin, I call it Smart, Smart Templates, which has the first iteration of this concept. But I’ve been working on the second iteration of it and the next iteration when that’s released, it will have these capabilities of progressive execution. I want to add a multi step execution, goes progressively through the template but also then repeats, you know, because maybe like as it got farther down to a later section, you know, it discovered something that would impact, you know, the first section. So then maybe you could say, you know, execute this or like create this or render the template progressively, but also do it three times, you know, so then the final output would be the third and you know, so I think question for you Brian,\nMatthew Oatts\njust to connect us to some of the other. Is this tied to that idea of like the progression dimension? Like this idea like you’ve talked in others lean coffees around. Like part of your intent and design for Smart Connections isn’t supposed to be just transactional, but actually is supposed to be able to like progressively elaborate on and not just look at the data that is retrieved in sort of its static state, but then keep up with the change control. And like I think I did again really crappy diagram of this last time. But this idea of your first notes was like you have ChatGPT look at something notes and then retrieve something back. But then like the future of these things is both being able to look at parts of your note and changing parts of your note, but then being able to look at what you’ve changed over time as you’ve changed parts of your note and use that to have better overall outcomes in terms of how you’re interacting with Smart Connections. Is that similar theme of what you were just talking about with smart templates.\n🌴 Brian\nSo the desired outcome of both is the same, you know, which is just improved outputs. The what I was just talking about would utilize that, what I was calling like a progression dimension basically that has to do with the, you know, like basically giving the AI the ability to retrieve like sequential memories, you know, like if you imagine how did you improve this note over time, you know, like. Having access to that data. That’s sort of what I was calling the progression dimension in the memory context. But as far as the smart template thing goes, it would be progression in the form of outputs from the AI. It’s like when the one is, they both would work together, the smart template would retrieve that past data of progression. But then this progression template rendering would be like right here, right now, generating a progression of output.\nMatt Parker\nWould this work for. I’m a manufacturing engineer, but root cause analysis, you know what I mean? Because I almost feel like that. Is that because root cause analysis you’re using, I can send you a template that we use, but it’s like a 6W 2H. So you’re kind of getting the overview of the thing, what, when, where, who, why, how much, how many. And then you kind of transfer that down into a fishbone. And the fishbone is like a problem solving technique. And you’re iterating exactly what you just said though. You’re iterating through a problem solving process and it’s refining it. Because as you gather information, right, you’re figuring out top causes and you’re ending up with a root cause analysis of some breakdown or whatever. But I almost feel like that’s what that template is doing that you’re\n🌴 Brian\nsaying, yeah, I think using that root cause analysis template that you already have, putting it into a smart template that can be executed progressively. I think the difference is you would get a better output from this progressive generation rather than if you just dumped everything into chat in context, you know, and just one shot at it.\nMatt Parker\nOne. One problem I always see in the, in the root cause analysis is people have trouble, like questioning the data they’re entering, right? Because you, you’re. It’s like you’re of this single track mind. So maybe we could work on that. But like, I could definitely see an RCA version of this that like, as you’re inputting information, the steps like the sys, the template, right? Would question you on like on some fact that you’re putting in, right? If you think something is broken down for some specific reason, it can give you like that branch of like. Well, did you consider this? This, this.\nMatthew Oatts\nCool, cool. I know we’re a couple minutes over. This was a really great conversation. What I do every time is in this mural board, I will essentially use the agent that we have that’s joined us to break down each of the parts of the conversation. I’ll paste that into the green folder here or the green spot on this Miro board, and then we can always. This is always persistent. So we can use this backlog of topics to maybe feed the next topic. Appreciate everybody accommodating the reschedule and then Matt, I think it’d be really cool. I just. Flagged your root cause thing if you have the time, energy or effort if you could maybe put some links to some of that near this post it note I’m going to stick that up in this other topic here.\nMatt Parker\nI can flatten out a template and send it to you but like it’s a it’s actually I work I work for manufacturing but it actually came from Procter and Gamble is who actually developed this but I can I can push that if you guys have any ideas of how to you know build that out I think that’d be I mean a lot of businesses use this right so it’s like it definitely has a use case for it.\n🌴 Brian\nYeah it would be interesting to see and I’ll keep that in mind as I’m designing and putting things together.\nMatt Parker\nSounds good.\nMatt Parker\nI’ll try to upload it to you guys and then go from there.\nMatthew Oatts\nThank you again for your time.

Today, I want to walk you through a feature update I just shipped in Smart Connect, something I’m pretty excited to share—Community Actions. This new update, inspired by the community plugins in Obsidian, opens up a way for you to customize Smart Connect with your own actions, adding some serious flexibility if you’ve been looking to get creative with automations and integrations.\nWe’ll start from scratch, download the update, and go over setting things up. For anyone already familiar with Smart Connect, this should feel pretty intuitive, but there are some new things to note if you want to get the most out of it.\nFirst Up: Downloading the Update\nSo, if you’re logging into Smart Connect for the first time since this update, you’ll see version 1.3.11 is ready to download. Once it’s installed, open it up, and you’ll notice some changes. I’ve added a section for Smart Actions where Community Actions will live, as well as a more refined system for managing Custom and Official GPTs.\nWhat Are Community Actions?\nBasically, Community Actions are like custom plugins that allow you to add new functions not initially built into Smart Connect. They’re perfect for anyone who wants to expand beyond the default set of features and get creative with their Smart Environment.\nI’ll show you a few examples of how you can use these Community Actions, but the main idea here is that you can install actions contributed by other users or even create your own. These actions live in a public repository, so you can inspect, tweak, or be inspired by other actions, which opens up tons of possibilities.\nGetting Set Up\nWhen setting up Smart Connect, one thing I recommend is naming your Smart Environment the same as your Obsidian vault, if you’re using it in tandem. This makes sure everything runs smoothly, especially if you’re using note-specific actions that require compatibility between Smart Connect and Obsidian.\nNow, once you go to Smart Actions, you’ll see two new sections—Official GPTs and Custom GPTs. Official GPTs will include pre-built actions that come with Smart Connect and will always be maintained to ensure stability. Custom GPTs, on the other hand, allow you to pick and choose specific actions you want to use, and even customize the system prompt.\nInstalling Your First Community Action\nFor this walkthrough, let’s install a “List Tweets” action as an example. Go to the Community Actions section, hit “Install” on List Tweets, and you’ll be prompted to restart. After that, you can see List Tweets in your Custom Actions list.\nWith this action, I can go to my Twitter feed or a specific Twitter list and pull up tweets, like, or bookmark them directly from within Smart Connect. To add more actions like “Bookmark Tweet,” it’s the same steps—just install, restart, and it’s ready to go.\nCreating a Custom GPT\nThe flexibility here is that Custom GPTs can be configured to use only the actions you need, which means you don’t have to worry about extra functionality cluttering up your workflow. Just add the actions you want to use, save it, and start giving it commands.\nA quick pro-tip: When setting up the custom GPT, you’ll paste the OpenAPI URL in the import section. This URL is basically what tells ChatGPT which actions are available and how to use them, which I’ll be expanding over time to make adding new actions even easier.\nReal-Time Action with Twitter\nNow, let’s see it in action. Let’s say I want a quick report on the top Obsidian-related tweets in my Twitter feed. I can ask ChatGPT to search my feed and even bookmark specific tweets, like those showing cool Obsidian workflows or personal knowledge management tips. Just type in your request, and it’ll pop up a Twitter window to do exactly that.\nA heads-up, you’ll want to be logged into Twitter first to make this work seamlessly. If not, you’ll get a prompt reminding you, so no worries if you forget.\nCustomization and Future Ideas\nThe cool thing about Community Actions is how customizable they are. Since they’re built on JavaScript, you can create actions for whatever platform or workflow you’re using—Twitter, LinkedIn, your inbox, you name it. I’ve designed these actions to open a Chromium browser on your desktop, which helps interact with websites as if you were doing it manually, making it easy to get around API restrictions on platforms like Twitter.\nI’ll keep updating the public repository with more action examples and documentation on creating your own actions. But if you’re already familiar with JavaScript, I think you’ll find it easy to start adding in custom actions.\nWrapping Up\nSo, that’s a quick look at Community Actions in Smart Connect. I hope you find them as useful as I do!
